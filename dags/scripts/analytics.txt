m_text : Supporters range across the parties and include Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and four ex-Conservative ministers. Reports have linked the two companies with human rights violations in China.The BBC asked both firms for comment. Hikvision accused anti-CCTV "fringe groups" of "demonising" the company. Recent This includes 73% of UK councils, 57% of secondary schools in England, and six out of 10 NHS trusts, as well as UK universities and police forces.A number of government departments, including the Home Office and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, have Hikvision cameras visibly in use on the front of their buildings, according to the civil liberties campaign group.These figures are based on replies received from Freedom of Information requests sent out by the group. It submitted more than 4,500, but fewer than three in 10 public bodies responded.More than a million Uyghurs and other minorities China has denied the allegations, and claimed the camps are "re-education" facilities used to combat terrorism.This video can not be playedThe calls for a ban, co-ordinated by Big Brother Watch, echo the In its response, the government said that it was "aware of reports that have suggested links between a number of Chinese technology companies, including Hikvision and Dahua, and human rights violations in Xinjiang".But so far it has not followed the committee's recommendations of a ban on the companies in the UK.In response to the parliamentarian's action it told the BBC "We take the security of our citizens, systems and establishments very seriously and have a range of measures in place to scrutinise the integrity of our arrangements.''The parliamentarians are calling for "a ban on the sale and operation of Hikvision and Dahua surveillance equipment in the UK and also condemn their involvement in technology-enabled human rights abuses in China".They also want the government to commission an independent national review of the use of CCTV in the UK.Among those backing the ban are former Conservative ministers David Davis MP, Lord Bethell, Steve Baker MP, and Damien Green MP; Labour peers Baroness Chakrabarti and Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws; SNP Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Alyn Smith; Green MP Caroline Lucas.Big Brother Watch's Madeleine Stone said "no democracy should have this kind of surveillance tech on its streets".Hikvision directed the BBC to Dahua Reports have alleged Dahua developed tools designed to identify Uyghurs.The move comes as discussion of the Procurement Bill resumes in Parliament on Monday.An amendment to the bill, supported by Big Brother Watch, would allow potential suppliers to be excluded because of concerns about human rights abuses.A recent proposal by the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, Fraser Sampson, to include consideration of suppliers' human rights record in the rules regulating police and local authorities' CCTV use was rejected by government.Responding to news of the call for a ban, Prof Sampson told the BBC: "The people we trust - the police and other emergency services, local authorities and the government itself - must be able to trust their surveillance partners".He added, "we're now at a moment where most people would agree there's a duty to act".In a statement Hikvision told the BBC, "CCTV has always played a critical role in the UK in the fight against crime and terrorism. Hikvision is proud of the role we play in that."The UK also has fringe groups who would like to see a massive reduction of CCTV in the UK who are willing to throw allegations around about CCTV, and who would lie to demonise Hikvision."Hikvision has always worked with government bodies to provide solutions to the UK's CCTV requirements".The firm also said its cameras "are compliant with the applicable rules and regulations of the countries we operate in and are subject to strict security requirements".

m_text : Nations are meeting again in Bonn to discuss progress since the Glasgow Climate Pact was signed at COP26. So, are they keeping their promises?In Glasgow, countries agreed to submit more ambitious climate plans, including cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).Carbon dioxide is Countries were given a However, recent analysis suggests that COP26 included a plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. World leaders also agreed to phase-out inefficient oil and gas subsidies. These are government payments that artificially lower the price of fossil fuels. The UN climate science body, the IPCC, says There are are now 34 countries China, However, India - the next largest consumer of coal - Fossil fuel subsidies also increased in 2021, More than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - This is seen as vital, as trees absorb Half the world's forests are in just five countries - Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China - so their actions could make a big difference.In April, US President Biden But in Brazil - home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest - Frances Seymour of research group the World Resources Institute (WRI) said this was not surprising "in light of the relaxation of environmental enforcement" by Brazil's government.Another challenge is in Russia, which is facing a significant wildfire season. It lost Richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (£72bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2022 - a pledge that was missed in 2020. Developing nations need the money to move away from fossil fuels, by doing things like investing in green technologies. They also need to prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. Despite the EU, US, Canada and Australia all increasing funding pledges, The UK, France, Germany and Japan are matching or providing more than needed.A The big emitters - China, Russia and India - are yet to join, although China Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming.  Last year, methane levels had seen their biggest annual increase since records began, Farming and the energy sector are the main sources of methane - and the increase in oil and gas use as Covid measures ease could be partially responsible.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Johnson "really does not like us - and we (do not like) him either".He said he hoped "more professional people" who can "make decisions through dialogue" would take over in London.Meanwhile, Russian foreign ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova told reporters Mr Johnson had been "hit by a boomerang launched by himself", adding that the moral of the story was "do not seek to destroy Russia".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has developed a close relationship with Mr Johnson since the start of the war, has yet to comment publicly on the end of his time in office.But his advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, took to Twitter to thank him for being "the first to arrive in Kyiv, despite missile attacks" and "always being at the forefront of supporting" Ukraine.The Russian officials were not the only critics however - Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's former Brexit coordinator said Mr Johnson's reign was ending in "disgrace, just like his friend Donald Trump". "EU - UK relations suffered hugely with Johnson's choice of Brexit," he added. Michel Barnier, the European Union's former chief negotiator, said Mr Johnson's departure "opens a new page in relations with" the UK - one he hoped would be "more constructive, more respectful of commitments made, in particular regarding peace & stability in Northern Ireland, and more friendly".However most international leaders haven't yet addressed Mr Johnson's imminent departure - possibly waiting until it is confirmed.But news outlets around the world have reported the dramatic events as they happened. Here are our correspondents in the US, Singapore and Europe with the view from where they are.Boris Johnson has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump through much of his ascent to the heights of British politics.Now he's taking a page out of the former US president's playbook.Concede nothing. Brush off the criticism. Press on. Make them tear the power from your hands.If there's one thing the former president proved in American politics, it is that norms and political traditions only matter if you acknowledge them. And that's something Trump never did.Even in his darkest days as president - through two impeachments and countless "has he finally gone too far?" controversies - Trump would point to his loyal base and cite, sometimes without evidence, the enormous support he had in surveys of Republicans and the comfortable margin by which he won the electoral (but not popular) vote in 2016.Johnson had pursued a similar strategy, citing the support of the millions who voted Conservative in the 2019 election, rather than the dissatisfaction of dozens of politicians and party functionaries who have abandoned him in recent days.Never mind that the US and British systems of government are decidedly different and that a presidential claim to a popular mandate - when voters checked a box next to their name on the ballot - is considerably stronger than that of a prime minister who governs at the behest of their party.And set aside that only in Trump's final weeks, after he had lost his re-election and a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol, did he see a mass exodus of advisors akin to what Johnson is experiencing.Trump showed that claiming to be the voice of the people against the elite establishment can be the political equivalent of a bulletproof vest. That's a lesson Johnson seems to have taken to heart.Is the EU rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's downfall? Yes - but also no. Over the last 24 hours I've been getting texts and calls from EU diplomats, filled with multiple question and exclamation marks. European media headlines drip disdain and incredulity at what they view as a political opera But the EU view has often been one of impatient disappointment that Mr Johnson lasted so long as prime minister. A number of European countries - particularly those in central and eastern Europe - are exceedingly grateful to Boris Johnson for his hard-line stance on Russia, even before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. But they believe that to be a UK position that will hold even after he is no longer prime minister.  This video can not be playedFew in mainland Europe will shed a tear when Mr Johnson goes. Politicians blame him for blustering his way through Brexit. They accuse him of failing to be honest with the British people about its true implications. Wholesale rejection of Mr Johnson's bill currently making its way through parliament, to unilaterally re-write the international post-Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland, has managed to unite the normally bickering EU institutions: the Commission, Parliament and Council. That said, no one I've spoken to in Brussels sounds particularly hopeful as to who may eventually take over from Mr Johnson as UK prime minister. Most here say they view the plethora of resignations of conservative ministers as self-interested career-saving attempts, rather than evidence they disagree with Mr Johnson's policies. Not even opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer talks about reversing Brexit, or noticeably softening it. The main EU hope expressed today is the same I heard immediately after the 2016 Brexit vote: EU politicians wish for a UK leader, they say, who has the political confidence to talk and negotiate with Brussels, rather than constantly playing to, and being distracted by, the political gallery at home. This is big news in places like Australia, India, Malaysia and here in Singapore as well of course - countries that have had historical links to the UK and inherited their parliamentary system as part of being previous colonies. And more than one commentator has asked the question - what kind of signal is the UK sending about the state of democracy to the rest of the world, when even after a number of his colleagues have asked for him to step down - ostensibly for the good of the country - the leader initially refused to go? Is this - many are wondering - the slow demise of the democratic system? There's also concern about how this might affect geopolitics, given the war in Ukraine, and whether this is a distraction in the West that again could take away from more pressing issues that Asian govts are concerned about - like the cost of living, inflation and the rising influence of China in the region.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The petite 20-year-old has carved out a small patch of influence in the male-dominated hurly-burly of Kenyan politics, in the informal settlement of Kibera in the capital, Nairobi, where she lives.For a fee, she seeks out unemployed people to attend rallies - and is happy to provide her service to any political party."I'm excited by the elections because I'm getting a job from politicians who want to show that they have the support of the people," she says. Election fever has gripped the country ahead of the 9 August poll - party slogans have become part of casual pleasantries, political posters are daubed across public places and the air is filled with music and chants broadcast from huge speakers mounted on campaign vehicles. Both upstarts and veteran politicians are leaving nothing to chance, because creating an impression of popularity is key - and that's where the crowds come in."Mobilising people to attend a rally is not a tough job because finding youths who are jobless is very easy," says Ms Mwazi, who does not plan to vote herself. "Politicians are all liars. During elections they flock here like sheep, promising: 'I'll do this, I'll give youth jobs.' But when you elect them they do nothing."Crowd mobilising is "a side-hustle", says Ms Mwazi. She normally buys sandals from a market and sells them via WhatsApp groups, and the money helps boost her mother's meagre income as a community health worker. During the campaign period, Ms Mwazi works with other crowd mobilisers and depending on the number of people requested, she can gather between 40 and 100 people."I earn 500 Kenya shillings ($5; £3) per event but some politicians are generous," Ms Mwazi says. The attendees earn a similar amount. "Politicians want their rivals to see that they have more support, so they take pictures of crowds and post on social media," Ms Mwazi says. She has had success in mobilising young women, but young men have proven to be more difficult."Men are not dependable, they complain about the money being offered," she says, adding that sometimes opposing groups of young people violently clash when they encounter each other on the campaign trail. In a country where at least 70% of the population is aged under 35, ensuring young voters show up at the polls is crucial for those running for office in the six elections being held simultaneously, including for the presidency, parliament and county governors.Candidates spend millions of dollars on campaign materials, logistics and communications, including hiring social media influencers to churn out favourable posts. They also have to keep up with increasingly demanding voters who prey on the politicians' desperation to win - Kenyan politicians are some of the best paid in the world.The country's political system is designed to make sure that those who spend the most money get elected, says renowned activist Boniface Mwangi, who unsuccessfully ran for MP in the 2017 election. "One candidate spent about $2m (£1.5m) to get elected to a seat as a member of parliament," he says. "It's very hard for a poor candidate to get elected because poor people don't elect poor people - poor people need to be incentivised to elect you." Mr Mwangi, who has more than two million followers on his social media accounts, regularly receives myriad pleas from young Kenyans, including job requests.He says this highlights the failure of politicians to create jobs, and adds that voters have become cynical - they cast their ballots for whoever pays them. "Some of the most popular politicians in this country are not popular because they are good leaders, they are popular because they are very generous with their money. Voters have decided that 'our votes are for sale' so it's become a transaction," Mr Mwangi says. "In a working democracy, the people you elect work for you. In Kenya the voters work for the politicians," he adds. Close to Ms Mwazi's one-room stone house, where she lives with her mother and two younger siblings, is a row of houses built from corrugated iron. They are separated by a narrow dirt path that is intermittently disrupted by multicoloured water pipes meandering through the vast maze of the sprawling slum. There, I meet James Mogaka or  "Jimmy Lawyer". He's smartly dressed and has short dreadlocks and is wearing red rubber gloves. He's unclogging a blocked trench, full of polythene bags, bottles and other waste.He earned his moniker, sometimes used as a cruel tease, because he studied law. But unable to get a formal job, he does manual work to earn a few shillings, as well as performing as an extra on local TV shows. Unlike Ms Mwazi, the 30-year-old plans to vote for a candidate who he thinks will bring about change. But he says that many young people find it difficult to stand by their convictions, and are forced to go through the demeaning experience of selling their votes to get "money for the stomach". "Voters know that even if they don't take cash from politicians, someone else will, and their problems will remain," he says.Kenya has a youth unemployment crisis, according to Jacqueline Mugo, executive director of Kenya's Federation of Employers."A disappointed, angry and impatient youth is a national problem… If you have young people who are unable to make ends meet and their parents increasingly unable to provide for them, that's a ticking time-bomb," she says."If you look at the age band of about 16 to 35, then the unemployment rate could be as high as 40%, so things are pretty bad but I don't think it can get worse than it is," Ms Mugo says, adding that the youth should remain politically engaged in order to achieve change.Ms Mwazi, who hopes to study culinary arts one day, is not convinced.In the coming weeks she will continue to hop from one rally to the next to earn a living, not expecting to hear from the politicians once the elections are over. "Most of them don't live here anyway," she says with a shrug.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The King's College London team looked at data from nearly 100,000 people who logged their Covid symptoms Just over 4% of those infected during the Omicron wave had logged long Covid symptoms, compared with 10% of those infected in the preceding, Delta, wave.But as far more were infected during the Omicron wave, the total was higher.In fact, the much bigger number of new infections during the Omicron wave "entirely trumped" the variant's potential lower risk of long Covid, Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, at The Open University, said."Anyway, you don't really have any choice about which virus variant you might be infected with," he said."What's more, nothing in these findings tells us what might happen with a different new variant, in terms of long Covid risk."The researchers tried to take into account other variables, such as how long ago someone had been vaccinated against Covid, but it is impossible to be certain the difference between variants caused the difference in long Covid numbers.Lead researcher Dr Claire Steves said: "The Omicron variant appears substantially less likely to cause long Covid than previous variants - but still, one out of every 23 people who catches Covid-19 goes on to have symptoms for more than four weeks.  "Given the numbers of people affected, it's important that we continue to support them at work, at home and within the NHS."Officials estimate long Covid has affected at least two million people in the UK. Prior to the Omicron wave, the While most people who catch Covid don't become severely ill and get better relatively quickly, some have long-term problems after recovering from the original infection - even if they weren't very ill in the first place.Long Covid isn't fully understood, and there's no internationally-agreed definition - so estimates of how common it is, or what the main symptoms are, vary.According to the NHS, these can include:Patient surveys suggest a range of other symptoms may also be present, including gut problems, insomnia and vision changes.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said soaring energy prices and pressures from an ageing population risked tipping the UK into a recession.Moving away from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones could also hit tax revenues, the OBR said.It forecast debt levels could more than treble in 50 years' time.High inflation is driving up interest payments. In May they hit £7.6bn, the highest level for that month on record and a £3.1bn jump from a year earlier. In its fiscal risks and sustainability report, the OBR said the government had already spent as much this year, 1.25% of GDP, to help households cope with the cost-of-living crisis as it did supporting the economy through the 2008 financial crisis.The OBR said bringing debt back to 75% of GDP, the level at which it stabilised in the government's pre-pandemic March 2020 Budget, "would need taxes to rise, spending to fall, or a combination of both"."The pressures of an ageing population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term," the OBR said.The government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars from 2030. Fuel duties are currently a big source of tax revenue.The Office for Budget Responsibility has for the first time combined its assessment of the sustainability of the government's finances with risks from wars, trade tensions, cyber attacks and the net zero transition.The overall picture is a sobering one for whoever takes over in Downing Street - a clear indication that tax rises will be required.Growth is assumed to be smaller, as the economy is less productive. Long-standing demographic challenges that will raise spending and old age dependency, have become worse, says the OBR, leading to government spending being concentrated on the NHS, social care and pensions payments and other areas of spending being squeezed. At the same time some sources of tax revenue, such as fuel duty, are on course to disappear entirely.The OBR also model the risk of today's energy shock persisting, a major cyber attack, and the need for a significant rise in defence spending to deal with new tensions around the world. The result would be ballooning government debts.While the portals of political power are focused very much on the short term, the OBR report is a warning of very many future risks, currently gaining little attention.The OBR said the Ukraine war, soaring energy prices and long-term pressure on the nation's finances "add up to a challenging outlook for this and future governments as they steer the public finances through inevitable future shocks"."Many threats remain, with rising inflation potentially tipping the economy into recession, continued uncertainty about our future trading relationship with the EU, a resurgence in Covid cases, a changing global climate, and rising interest rates all continuing to hang over the fiscal outlook," it said.Households are currently being hit by higher fuel, food and energy costs. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 9.1%. It has led to many people cutting back on spending, especially on food and car journeys, It has also fuelled fears that the UK could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - But the OBR said the current energy price woes may not be as bad as that seen in the 1970s."While the oil crises of the 1970s saw global energy prices rise by a similar magnitude as we have seen in the wake of the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are reasons to believe that the overall impact on inflation, output, and unemployment will be less severe and less persistent this time around," it added.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Their town, Lismore, was caught in the catastrophic floods that submerged southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in February and March. Those floods have become the The latest flooding to hit Australia Back in February, perched on a hill the Sprogis family home was safe, but the couple were worried about their downtown physiotherapy business. It was purposely located on the second floor but even that was not enough.From the water-height charts they could tell the office was going to be inundated, but it was too late to save anything, the authorities had already issued an evacuation order."We could have put things up higher at that time, had we known, but we didn't," says Mr Sprogis, who had been at his practice the night before."I even left my new laptop on the office desk, thinking, well, [the water has] never been in here before so it won't come in." By the following day, his practice was 1.8m underwater, files, records and equipment all damaged or lost.Meanwhile in New South Wales in Gibberagee, children's book author Candy Lawrence watched as 2,000 copies of her books were sucked into the deluge.Ms Lawrence had been carefully watching government flood warnings and gathering supplies, anticipating that nearby roads would be cut off, as often happened when the area flooded.But, like Mr Sprogis, she was not expecting water to sweep through her property and that of her neighbours, some of whom had to scramble onto their roof to escape the fast-rising floodwaters."I feel like the world is pretty much ending, so why bother educating children?," she says, referencing her destroyed book collection and the terrifying new weather patterns.Like thousands of others caught in the disaster, Mr Sprogis and Ms Lawrence would have liked more warning. So why wasn't there a better system, which could alert them in real-time if their properties were in danger?Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer specialising in hydrology and flooding asked this question after watching her friend's house in Brisbane flood over the roof peak in 2011. The question came up again after she moved to Calgary, Canada, and witnessed a similarly devastating flood in 2013.Ms Murphy knew that during the Brisbane and Calgary floods, hydrology forecasts had predicted where rivers would peak at certain bridges, but she realised it wasn't enough. "If you aren't a hydraulic engineer [who is able] to translate that flood height into an impact to properties - your personal property, your car - it can be very challenging," she says. Ms Murphy also notes that static flood maps - including those that chart one-in-100-year floods - are also expensive, and can take days, or weeks, to produce. This makes them more suited to development planning and infrastructure design applications, rather than emergency planning and management."I was thinking, there has to be something more," says Ms Murphy. She began dedicating her evenings and weekends to looking for a solution, which eventually led her to co-found FloodMapp with web developer, Ryan Prosser.With a significant research and development investment, FloodMapp was launched in 2018.FloodMapp's technology can rapidly forecast water levels to map floods before they happen. It does this by ingesting huge amounts of historical data (including things like rainfall and ground saturation levels) and uses artificial intelligence to accurately model the way water will behave.The software also uses information about land features and river systems to work out how a flood will affect different areas. The company claims its models can run 100,000 times faster than traditional techniques.An added benefit is that the resulting models can refresh hourly using real-time river sensor data and rainfall forecasts.The technology is not available to individuals, instead it is being integrated into services offered by government agencies in Australia and the US, to better understand floods before, during and after they happen. Researchers at the University of Melbourne's Department of Infrastructure Engineering are taking a similar approach, understanding that speed is key for emergency planning.Like Ms Murphy, flood modeller turned researcher, Dr Wenyan Wu, is looking at ways to simulate flood levels over time, at speed, using machine learning techniques. Importantly, this is being done Dr Wu says without compromising accuracy and without costing the earth.The availability of accurate real-time data that can be interpreted at a property-specific level is a huge part of the challenge, but being able to disseminate meaningful data to the public is also key. As Dr Wu says, "If people's collective comprehension [of flood risk] doesn't improve, you will not actually improve the situation."Even the concept of a one-in-100-year flood is widely misunderstood. (It means a flood event has a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, as opposed to there only being one major flood every 100 years.)That's where companies like the Australian-based Early Warning Network (EWN) come in. EWN sends opt-in SMS (text messages), email, landline and app push alerts to residents and businesses in at-risk areas, typically via insurers, councils and other government agencies who have signed up to their services. Flood alerts are primarily based on data collected and distributed by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.However, as operations manager Michael Bath explains, EWN has a 24/7 team of human severe weather forecasters (all of whom have an understanding of threats from their experience as storm chasers). This team assess the warnings, eliminate duplication, and send geo-targeted alerts, using custom-made software.This ensures people receive clear and localised information."If you've ever had automated warnings from weather agencies before, [you'll know] they can be very repetitive," says Mr Bath. "If you automatically send that to residents, they just get really annoyed with it and tune out."  Mr Bath, Dr Wu and Ms Murphy all agree that ultimately governments need to adopt these systems and technologies, and make planning decisions about whether future development should be permitted on floodplains and whether buy-back schemes are warranted in high-risk areas.However, in many cases, moving entire communities or renovating properties at scale using flood-resistant materials is not practical in the immediate future, given these measures require significant funding and political will."We need something today, right now, because we are living on floodplains, and emergency warnings and alerts fill a critical role to improve safety, to save lives and prevent damage," says Ms Murphy. "We have to work together to build a safer future."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Fifty-nine people face a variety of charges including manslaughter and safety failures.Families of those who died say they are not just hoping for justice."A different Italy can come out of this trial," said Egle Possetti, head of the committee for victims of the disaster."It's the tip of an iceberg because it's not just the Morandi bridge that had problems but the country's entire infrastructure that has to be controlled in a proper manner," she told Ansa news agency.  The bridge, on the A10 motorway through Genoa, linked northern Italy to France. A 200m (656ft) section came down during a storm and torrential rain on 14 August 2018 sending dozens of vehicles plunging 45m to the dry riverbed below.The disaster has been blamed on cables, encased in concrete in a bridge pillar, which became corroded by sea air. Many of the 59 on trial worked for Italian motorway firm Autostrade per Italia (Aspi) and Spea engineering company, which was responsible for looking after the bridge.Most of them are accused of knowing the bridge could collapse but failing to act and all the defendants deny the charges against them. The charges range from multiple manslaughter to wilfully removing safety features in the workplace and harming transport safety.The collapse of a bridge and the desperate search for bodies are still vivid memories for those who witnessed the deadly disaster in torrential rain four years ago.I was in Genoa visiting my parents, driving to the city centre, when the traffic suddenly became paralysed and a large cloud of smoke rose into the air. I soon realised something was wrong when I saw scooters rushing back on the wrong side of the road. I got out of my car and when the smoke cleared I saw that the majestic bridge that once linked the French and Italian Rivieras and that I had passed under thousands of times was no longer there. It had crumbled within seconds. A girl whose car was hit by chunks of concrete told me it had come down like sand. Cars fell from the bridge while a truck underneath it was destroyed - its driver escaping with his face covered in blood. A shiny new bridge was built in record time. But Genoa and its people are still angry and grieving and watching this trial very closely.Outside the court on Thursday, survivor Gianluca Ardini said he felt compelled to come to the trial to be close to the victims' families. He was left stranded for hours in his van 20m above the ground before he was rescued with severe injuries. His colleague was killed. "What happened is a disgrace - the leaders of Aspi knew how badly that damned bridge had been looked after, but they didn't intervene so they could make more money."Former Aspi chief executive Giovanni Castellucci is among the best known of those on trial. His lawyer said it was important to establish the truth behind the bridge collapse, and the trial would find out that a construction defect was responsible for the disaster.Although a number of executives and staff from Aspi and Spea are defendants, the companies themselves have already agreed an out-of-court settlement with prosecutors. The motorway company itself has been renationalised since the bridge collapsed. Its current chief executive, Roberto Tomasi, is on a prosecution list of 178 witnesses.Ms Possetti, who lost her sister, brother-in-law and two nephews in the collapse, told reporters outside the court that it was a difficult day but a very important one. "Today we are beginning a long and tiring journey that will bring truth and justice to our families."A marquee was set up outside the court for anyone who wants to watch the trial unfold. After Thursday's initial hearing, chaired by three judges, the case was adjourned until September and will continue until July next year.The old Morandi bridge has since been replaced by a new structure designed by Genoa-born architect Renzo Piano.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Millions of women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in June, after the Supreme Court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision.The judgement has paved the way for individual states to ban the procedure.They have become local battlegrounds in the fight to overturn or uphold abortion services. At the same time, Google says it is taking steps to remove data from users' location histories that could be used to prosecute people for visits to US abortion clinics.Women in states where abortion is banned or restricted may be forced to cross state lines to parts of the country where the procedure remains legal.Speaking at a virtual meeting with Democratic state governors, Mr Biden said he believed some US states would attempt to arrest women who crossed state lines for abortion access. "I don't think people believe that's going to happen. But it's going to happen," he said.  The president added that the government would ensure access to pills that caused abortion in states where it was prohibited.But a federal government intervention may lead to more legal challenges that may go all the way to the Supreme Court, Dr Matthew Wilson, a political science expert at Southern Methodist University, told the BBC, particularly if states believe that the federal government "is actively working to subvert and undermine state laws".The overturning of Roe v Wade has sent shockwaves throughout the  US.It was the Supreme Court ruling that ensured that pregnant women were entitled to an abortion during the first three months of their pregnancy, while allowing for legal restrictions and bans in the second and third trimester.Thirteen states have already severely curtailed or blocked abortion access since the court's decision.Mr Biden said only Democratic victories in the mid-term elections would give Congress the power to restore federal abortion rights - this will go one way or another after November, he said.The BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says there are now fears that in states limiting abortion, police could try to access search histories and geolocation data on smartphones owned by people who are pursuing plans to terminate a pregnancy.With this in mind, Google says that in the coming weeks, it will start deleting information when its systems identify a trip to an abortion clinic, counselling centre, domestic violence shelter or other facilities that provide "particularly personal" services. Entries in a user's location history will be removed soon after a visit to a sensitive location.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The play will be "set within the world and mythology of Stranger Things" and be made by director Stephen Daldry and producer Sonia Friedman, Netflix said.It will be one of a number of new projects to be overseen by Stranger Things creators the Duffer brothers.The screen spin-off will be "based on an original idea" from the pair.This video can not be playedNetflix gave few details, but Ross Duffer recently told the Happy Sad Confused podcast that the series would "1,000% different" from the current show.Matt Duffer added: "I've read these rumours that there's gonna be an Eleven spin-off, that there's gonna be a Steve and Dustin spin-off, or that it's another number."That's not interesting to me because I feel like we've done all that. We've spent I don't know how many hours exploring all of that. So it's very different."It is not known whether the stage play will also take a different direction or adapt the existing series. There are also no details about whether it is likely to launch in the UK given that it is being led by a British pair.Friedman has staged a number of major shows in the West End and Broadway, including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Jerusalem and The Inheritance.Daldry, who made his name directing Billy Elliott, won a string of theatre awards for The Inheritance, his last major play, which opened in London in 2018.Wednesday's Netflix announcement came days after the release of the final part of the fourth and penultimate season of Stranger Things. It has become the first season of an English-language programme to be watched for more than one billion hours on the streaming giant.That success has led the company to announce a string of new projects to be masterminded by the Duffers.Netflix revealed the brothers had launched their own production firm called Upside Down Pictures - named after Stranger Things' nightmarish realm.Their company will also make a new series based on Japanese manga and anime hit Death Note - which was already turned into a Netflix film in 2017 - and an adaptation of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy novel The Talisman.Netflix co-chief executive and chief content officer Ted Sarandos said: "Matt and Ross are an exceptionally unique talent with a vision so crisp and clear."They are all about the details - it's no accident that Stranger Things has pierced the zeitgeist to become the epic pop culture phenomenon it is today."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : On Monday, the consumer protection authority said restaurants could no longer add service charge by default.The order came after an increase in complaints from customers being forced to pay the charge.But the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) defended the practice, saying it was not "illegal". In a statement released on Wednesday, the NRAI - which which represents 500,000 restaurants across India - said that the guidelines were creating "unnecessary confusion" among the consumers and had allegedly led to a "disruption in smooth business operations of restaurants".A spokesperson from the association told the BBC that the rules were just "guidelines", which meant that they weren't compulsory to follow. The NRAI's stance has set the stage for a confrontation between the government and restaurant owners.Under the new guidelines announced on Monday, restaurants were barred from collecting tips from customers "under any other name" or "deny service or entry to customers who refuse to pay a tip". But the NRAI objected to this - it said that restaurant owners could levy a service charge on a product as it "constituted one of the components of the total price of the product" and that it was "a universally accepted trade practice".It cited several judgements by India's Supreme Court and high courts over the years that have upheld levying of service charge and said that no authority could interfere with the practice "unless it is shown and proved to be unconscionable or against any unfair trade practice".Moreover, the association says, service charge also has a socio-economic angle.Generally tips are paid to and pocketed by staff and restaurant owners say a service charge ensures that the money is shared among all the staff who work behind the scenes, such as the chefs, janitors, cleaners and dishwashers."Any move to scrap the system would be detrimental to the interests of workers - and against the labour-friendly stance of the government," the NRAI said.  In 2017, the government's consumer affairs department issued a set of guidelines saying that customers only had to pay the prices displayed on the menu card along with government taxes.The department said that people could use their "discretion" on whether or not to leave a tip and that extra charges without the customer's consent amounted "to unfair trade practice".The government had instead encouraged restaurants to Restaurants have, however, continued to add the tip to the bill, leaving it up to patrons to contest the extra charge.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

About 540,000 people have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the UK and more than 69,000 of them are in the capital.Some sufferers say the lack of toilets is the worst thing about living in the city.Bethany Jacobs has Crohn's disease and lives with a permanent stoma bag. She said: "I think you do need to break down those barriers and open up these conversations where we talk about invisible illnesses such as Crohn’s disease."© 2022 BBC.

m_text : BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too.Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.

"It's about time some mention was made why it's so critical," said Charles."We try and build it in," Derek said.His fellow weather presenter Sabrina Lee explained how she did a mini-series for the COP26 climate conference "talking about the climate change stripes (a form of warning system) in Wales to see how the temperature has changed since 1850. "Last summer Wales had its first extreme heat warning and we tried to investigate whether climate change played a part in this," she added. Derek told the prince his interest in the weather started in 1976 when he decided he wanted to be a meteorologist."I'm always intrigued watching the local weather," Prince Charles said in response. Charles's The prince also met members of the BBC's centre of excellence for climate and science journalism, which is moving from London to Cardiff. "Are you covering the remarkable advances and innovative approaches to energy?" the prince asked. BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt replied that wind generation is "getting better" with the Crown Estate "As long as they're not sailing into my boat," Prince Charles said with a smile. "I hope there's a bit of tethering."There was also a meeting with cafeteria staff, including 61-year-old cook Robert Jones, who said as he shook hands with the prince: "It's my birthday today so thanks for making the effort" "Shouldn't you have a day off?" Charles shot back. "No, this was much more important," Mr Jones replied. Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted in the foyer of BBC Central Square by the choir from Mount Stuart Primary School in Cardiff.The royal couple's visit continued with a She was head teacher of Mount Stuart school, Wales' first black head, and a black history campaigner.Betty's son, Antony Campbell said his family was "very proud" to have the royals visiting the monument."[My mum] probably would have said don't make a fuss," he said.

m_text : Avabai Wadia, 19, became the first woman from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to pass the bar exam in the United Kingdom. Her success encouraged the Ceylonese government to allow women to study law in the country.This was not the only time Wadia spurred government policies on women's rights. By the time she died in 2005, she had become a globally respected figure in the family planning movement, combining a lawyer's acumen with a dedication to socially uplifting women.Wadia was born in 1913 in a progressive Parsi family in Colombo. After qualifying as a lawyer, she worked in both London and Colombo despite omnipresent "masculine prejudice". She moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) during World War Two and immersed herself in social work, but found her true calling in family planning. "It seems my life work presented itself to me rather than my consciously searching for it," she wrote in her autobiography, The Light is Ours. "I did not feel it a waste not to carry on with a legal career, for law was a fortifying element in all that I undertook."When she began working in the field in the late 1940s, family planning was a taboo topic across much of the world. Aside from stoking opposition from religious conservatives, it also had ugly links with racism and eugenics. "The first time I heard the words 'birth control', I was revolted," Wadia noted. But she was profoundly affected by a female doctor in Bombay who said that Indian women "oscillated between gestation and lactation until death wound up the sorry tale". Despite the threat of social ostracism, Wadia plunged into the cause. In 1949, she helped establish the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), an organisation she would head for 34 years. FPAI's work ranged from promoting contraceptive methods to providing fertility services - the latter gave Wadia "a real sense of satisfaction" since she had suffered miscarriages and had no children. It was in large part due to Wadia's efforts that the Indian government became the first in the world to officially promote family planning policies in 1951-52.Under Wadia, FPAI adopted a decentralised, community-based approach, working with the urban poor and villagers from some of the most impoverished regions of India. This meant that, quite often, the FPAI did "anything but family planning" - it undertook projects ranging from reforestation to road-building. Linking family planning with a holistic agenda of education, skill development and health, Wadia and her team employed creative communication techniques such as singing FPAI's innovative style of work fostered public confidence and led to marked improvements in development indicators. For instance, a project which began in the 1970s in Malur in Karnataka, resulted in reduced infant mortality, a significant increase in the average age of marriage, and the doubling of literacy rates. The project evoked such popular support that villagers took over its management after FPAI exited the scene.Perhaps due to her international upbringing, Wadia brought a global perspective to Indian family planning. Inspired by the success of South Korean mothers' clubs, which bolstered widespread acceptance of family planning in rural areas, she organised close-knit groups where women could discuss pressing social issues ranging from dowry to female under-representation in politics. At the same time, she became a leading figure in the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), spotlighting the unique challenges faced by India in controlling its ballooning demographics.Politics further complicated these challenges. During the Emergency, which was imposed from 1975 to 1977, the Indian government adopted draconian population control measures including forced sterilisation. Wadia condemned this, warning against coercion in family planning programmes and declaring that participation had to be strictly voluntary. Family planning was beginning to show good results but, she lamented, the Emergency "brought the whole programme into disrepute."In the early 1980s, Wadia faced another formidable challenge as president of the IPPF. She locked horns with the administration of US president Ronald Reagan, which cut funding from the country to any organisation which provided or endorsed abortion services. Although the IPPF did not officially promote abortion, some of its affiliates provided abortion services in countries where it was legal. The IPPF refused to cave into US pressure to change this arrangement, resulting in a loss of $17m in funding to its programmes. Wadia ridiculed the Reaganite notion that free market economics would combat population growth. Anyone who believed that, she averred, "has never been anywhere in the developing word - there are too many of the absolute poor, and you just can't leave it to laissez-faire".In many ways, Wadia's career is of pressing relevance to contemporary dilemmas in family planning. In the United States, conservatives have argued that the reversal of abortion rights in Wadia - who was involved in conceptualising India's own abortion law - worried about how abortion could be weaponised in a larger movement against birth control. "Those who try to confuse the public by equating abortion with family planning," she argued, "are trying to destroy human and individual rights."Today in India, political debates abound about "We cannot support disincentives which do not uphold basic human rights," she said in 2000, when Maharashtra state - in a bid to enforce a two-child norm - considered stripping any third-born child of food rations and free primary education. "In practice, anyway, we have found that disincentives don't work."These events have demonstrated that family planning is intrinsically linked to law and politics. Perhaps it was fortuitous, therefore, that India had a pioneering female lawyer as one of the principal architects of its family planning movement.Above all, Wadia's career is a reminder that family planning cannot be divorced from overall socioeconomic development.A few years before Wadia's death, MS Swaminathan - the scientist who led India's Green Revolution, which helped the country achieve food security - paid tribute to this fact. "More than anybody else," he said, Wadia "knew that if our population policies go wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : President Volodomyr Zelensky told this week's meeting of Nato: "We need to break the Russian artillery advantage. We need much more modern systems."If Ukraine did not receive the weapons it needed to defeat Russia, he said, Nato leaders would face a future war with Moscow themselves.Huge amounts of military equipment have been given to Ukraine by more than 30 countries, but heavy weaponry has been slow to arrive and in some areas Ukrainian troops have been heavily out-gunned.In terms of spending, the US has committed to providing far more than any other individual country.The UK and Poland have committed to spending the second and third largest amounts.In terms of money already spent, rather than commitments to spend, the White House says the US has provided The UK says it has provided President Zelensky has appealed for more funding, and has said the monthly cost of defence for Ukraine was about $5bn (£4.1bn).Military professionals say success on the battlefield requires a huge range of weaponry, as well as training, spare parts and other support."No weapon system is a silver bullet," according to General Mark Milley, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.However, several weapon systems are believed to have played key roles in the conflict so far.With Ukrainian positions in the east of the country under intense Russian bombardment, analysts say Ukraine badly needs better supplies of artillery and ammunition to hold on to key positions.So far, it is thought that 10 long-range multiple rocket launchers have been either delivered to Ukraine or are on the way, from the US, UK and Germany.Ukraine says many more are needed to stall Russia's advance. The US systems are M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars.Crucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.The munitions currently supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 43.5 miles (70km), which is comparable to the Smerch system on the Russian side.However, Himars is much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. Australia, Canada and the US have also sent more than 100 M777 howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine.The range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's  D-30 towed gun.Ukraine's own Warsaw Pact-designed artillery uses 152mm shells. But with stocks running low, Ukraine is shifting to the Nato-configured 155mm ammunition. Re-orienting Ukraine's ammunition supplies is complicated and difficult, and reports suggest that Ukrainian forces are suffering a serious shortage in some areas.The West has been relatively slow to respond to Ukraine's request for heavy weapons. In the early stages of the war there were concerns about provoking Russia. Politicians also seriously underestimated the level of Ukrainian resistance..Over time those attitudes have changed, though there are still questions about the west's resolve to keep supplying Ukraine with arms.At first the focus was on providing Ukraine with compatible weapons - the ones they've been trained to use. That included soviet era tanks, air defence systems and ammunition. The US and other allies helped scour Europe for similar weapons, but those stockpiles have been slowly running dry.So there is now a transition to sending more modern western weapons with the hope that it will be more sustainable in the longer term.But that has brought more challenges. Modern weapons systems are often more complex and require training, not just in how to operate them, but to maintain and repair them.  Western weapons are also designed for a Western way of war, one that's focussed more on precision than quantity and mass. For Ukraine, fighting for its life against overwhelming odd, numbers still matter. Ukraine still believes it's not getting enough weapons. At the very start of the war Ukraine appealed for more fighter jets. So far not one has been delivered.At least 5,000 shoulder-launched Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have been supplied to Ukraine.The weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion."Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war," according to Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute.Ukraine has received more than 230 Warsaw Pact-designed tanks from Poland and the Czech Republic.Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew.Poland's donation of tanks has been partly back-filled by alternative weaponry from allied nations, including Challenger 2 tanks from the UK.Drones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations.Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.Analysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.They are believed to have destroyed They have also been used to provide the exact locations of Russian positions for precision artillery strikes.Ukraine has successfully denied Russia full control of Ukrainian airspace during the conflict, but has called repeatedly for better air defence systems.In the coming days, Washington is expected to announce that it will send NASAMS, an advanced surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine.Kyiv has also received S-300 air defences from Slovakia.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedA Russian-Ukrainian family has been irrevocably split by the war in Ukraine after Russian-born Ekaterina Volkova was injured in an air strike and her Ukrainian husband killed in the same attack.This was the second time Russia had dropped a missile on their apartment building. In late April, a Radio Liberty journalist was killed in the same building. Ukrainian authorities said the incident showed Russia’s indiscriminate bombing was even targeting their own citizens. The BBC’s Anastassiya Zlatopolskai has tracked down the family in Kyiv who say the attack was unforgivable. Producer: Hanna Tsyba© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The process, a guide explains, is not to protect people, but the product. On the other side of the secure door, lies the UK's largest semi-conductor manufacturing facility, an environment one hundred times cleaner than a hospital operating theatre.Inside ghostly white figures in suits move pods on trolleys. Robotic arms extract silicon wafers which are coated with photosensitive material. Then light is projected on to the wafer to print the pattern of the chips. What you end up with are semi-conductors - often known as microchips or just chips - on which much of our modern lives depend."Every silicon semiconductor product starts with a grain of sand," says Mary Curtis, a programme manager who has been working at the site for more than three decades, explaining that what comes out of the high-volume Newport plant ends up in cars around the world as well as white goods like washing machines.Newport has been operating since the 1980s but it has been thrust into the spotlight as an unlikely front-line in a new struggle between the West and China.Last July, after it hit financial difficulties, Newport Wafer Fab was acquired by Nexperia, one of its customers. Nexperia is headquartered in the Netherlands but its ultimate owners are Chinese firm Wingtech Technology.And that set off alarm bells."It's not in the strategic interest of the United Kingdom, the United States or any other allies that China gains prominence in the global semiconductor industry," says Martijn Rasser, a former CIA analyst and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.Semi-conductors are one crucial area in technology where China has struggled. Washington has taken advantage of this by restricting supplies to the Chinese telecoms company Huawei, causing it considerable pain. China is desperate to catch up and reduce its dependency.That means the UK selling its largest facility to a company with Chinese ownership has met with resistance. Washington, especially Congress, will "lean heavily" to prevent the acquisition from being concluded says Mr Rasser.But alarm bells did not initially seem to ring loud within the UK government. The National Security Adviser carried out a review whose conclusions remain unclear. It was only this May, close to a year after the sale and after heaving lobbying, that ministers ordered a national security review under new powers. This is due imminently (unless there is an extension) and could force the unwinding of the purchase.The issues are thorny though.The national security concerns are not about highly sensitive technology being made at the site with a defence or intelligence role. Rather it is about not having to rely on chips made overseas."We do need to build up our own domestic resilience as the US is doing, as the European Union is doing, as indeed many other countries around the world [are] trying to do," argues Tom Tugendhat, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee who has campaigned against the sale. "But in order to do it, we need to have the building blocks. Newport Wafer Fab is one of those building blocks."The Newport facility does not make the most advanced semi-conductors. Taiwan is home to these and catching up is enormously costly - perhaps up to £10bn ($12bn) to build a state of the art fab and even this does not guarantee you can maintain a leading edge. Some question if the UK really has the will and resources to invest at this level.But if it did, Newport is almost all it has to build on. It has also helped create a tech cluster in the local area.Nexperia says being part of a global business is vital. "By investing in the UK, Nexperia has helped to secure the long-term health of the semiconductor industry here," it said in a submission to a parliamentary committee. Within the plant, there is support for the takeover. The Chinese acquisition provided job security for the 500 employees and the promise of modernisation after a period of uncertainty. "The future wasn't looking very bright," one employee says.The future of Newport goes to the heart of a bigger question - what is the government's over-arching China strategy? How far does it balance Chinese investment with security risks? A promised policy has yet to appear amid talk of splits between those focused on growth and those focused on security.Inside the sterile fab, the final stage involves imprinted wafers being carefully examined for impurities. For years, the UK has been able to maintain a somewhat messy policy when it came to issues around Chinese investment. But now, under intense scrutiny, that looks to be getting harder.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The scammer disappeared in 2017 as her cryptocurrency OneCoin was at its height - attracting billions from investors. Fraud and money-laundering charges in the US have led to her The Oxford-educated entrepreneur told investors she had created the "Bitcoin killer", but the files suggest she secretly amassed billions in her rival currency before she disappeared.Details first surfaced in 2021 in leaked documents from Dubai's courts, posted online by a lawyer who crowned Dr Ruja - as she's known - the "most successful criminal in history".A new book and upcoming episodes of BBC podcast We have been able to independently verify some - but not all - of the information in the Dubai files. At the very least, the leak suggests Dubai was an important financial route for Dr Ruja, something the FBI alluded to in naming the United Arab Emirates as one of five countries she has known connections to."You've got hundreds of millions of dollars at stake here," said Dr Jonathan Levy, the lawyer who first posted the files online, and who is relying on information from them in The claim was lodged with the Supreme Court of the British Indian Ocean Territory, chosen because it hosted a web domain allegedly used by OneCoin.  Dr Levy received thousands of documents, mostly in Arabic, from a whistleblower who he said thought it was wrong that people were being "unjustly enriched" in Dubai.The most tantalising claim made in Dr Levy's legal case is that a massive Bitcoin deal was struck with an Emirati royal, Sheikh Saoud bin Faisal Al Qassimi, the son of a wealthy business tycoon.The files further suggest that in 2015, Sheikh Saoud gave Dr Ruja four USB memory sticks containing 230,000 bitcoin - worth €48.5m at the time. In return, Dr Ruja handed over three cheques to Sheikh Saoud from Mashreq Bank, totalling around 210m Emirati dirhams, roughly €50m.Prior to the alleged deal, Dubai's Mashreq Bank had begun closing Dr Ruja's accounts amid money-laundering concerns, so the cheques were unable to be cashed. In 2020, the Dubai authorities unfroze Dr Ruja's funds, despite the fact that more than a year earlier the US Department of Justice had published an indictment for her, labelling OneCoin a Months before the decision, Dr Ruja's former fund manager Mark Scott was also found guilty in New York of laundering $400m in OneCoin proceeds. Asked by the BBC about the decision, Dubai's Public Prosecutor did not respond.According to Dubai Court of Appeal records, on 28 April 2022, Sheikh Saoud was seeking to have Dr Ruja's funds handed to him - suggesting a deal of some kind did originally take place between the pair. Dr Ruja herself is named as a respondent, despite not being seen in public for nearly five years. Little is known about Sheikh Saoud, but sources tell us the stocky body-building enthusiast is rarely seen in public.He features in a 2017 YouTube video for an organisation called the Intergovernmental Collaborative Action Fund for Excellence (ICAFE) which claims to support education initiatives, but after the Dubai files were released, references to Sheikh Al Qassimi as ICAFE's "Secretary-General" disappeared from its website. A recently launched cryptocurrency also lists the sheikh as its chairman. The Dubai files appear to show a once close relationship between the Al Qassimi family and Dr Ruja.On 3 September 2015, Dubai's Mashreq Bank wrote to Dr Ruja to explain that it would be closing her personal accounts.Eleven days later, an email admitted to a US court shows Dr Ruja writing to a OneCoin colleague about moving €50m out of Mashreq Bank. She mentions a meeting the following week with "one of the Sheiks [sic] in Dubai" where she would "try to get something done for us".It is not known who Dr Ruja intended to meet or even if a meeting took place, but the files hint at one possible explanation. A photo from the files seemingly dated 8 October 2015 but taken at an unknown place, pictures Dr Ruja standing next to Sheikh Faisal, the father of Sheikh Saoud. The Al Qassimi family rules Sharjah, which borders Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), the northernmost emirate. Sheikh Faisal did not respond to us about his family's relationship with Dr Ruja.The files also include a diplomatic ID, issued to Ruja as a "special adviser" to ICAFE - the organisation with which Sheikh Saoud once held a senior role.The organisation appears to be connected to the United Nations, but a spokesman for the UN Secretary-General could not find any records of it being affiliated through normal routes. Co-founder Shariar Rahimi said ICAFE was "registered" with the UN, but failed to provide evidence of this. On Dr Ruja, he said any ICAFE documents provided to her came from Sheikh Saoud.Some time after Dr Ruja's alleged Bitcoin deal, their relationship appears to have soured - one letter among the leaked files shows Sheikh Saoud dismissing Dr Ruja from a role as an ICAFE ambassador, before later becoming involved in a legal dispute over her assets.The case between the pair concluded in Dubai's Court of Appeal on 28 June.Asked about the alleged Bitcoin deal, his relationship with Dr Ruja, and his role at ICAFE, Sheikh Saoud's lawyer did not directly respond, but wrote: "All the information you have is baseless".The alleged Bitcoin transaction is said to have taken place using what's called cold-storage wallets, making it very difficult to ascertain if it actually happened. Bitcoin transactions can often be traced because all transfers of the virtual currency between wallets are recorded on a publicly viewable database. However, the court documents do not include any details about which - or how many - wallets these bitcoins were stored on.    If she does still have them, Dr Ruja might find it difficult to move such a large amount of bitcoin. Crypto-author David Birch thinks "Getting rid of a few billion dollars' worth is much harder than you think," he said.If Dr Ruja still has the 230,000 bitcoins, she would be one of the currency's largest holders. In November 2021, her stake would have peaked at nearly $15bn, but at the time of writing it has dropped to around $5bn, still more than enough to help her stay hidden.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too.Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.

m_text : The Unite union said an agreement was reached after "extensive" talks.Both Unite and GMB union members will now be balloted on the new pay deal."We welcome that BA has finally listened to the voice of its check-in staff," said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.Nadine Houghton, GMB national officer, added: "All our members were asking for was what they were owed. British Airways finally moving on pay is long overdue."All our members - who are predominantly low-paid women - wanted was to be given back the pay cuts BA imposed on them during the pandemic, threatening them with fire and rehire if they said no."BA said it was "very pleased" the unions had decided not to issue dates for industrial action. "This is great news for our customers and our people," a statement said.Last month, workers, who are mostly check-in staff, voted to go on strike over pay, with unions saying the action was If the strikes had gone ahead, BA, which operates from terminals three and five at Heathrow, had plans to cover staff, including managers potentially dealing with check-ins.However, there would still have been disruption for passengers, especially at terminal five, leading to cancellations.The airline had originally offered a 10% temporary bonus for staff instead of a reversal of the pay cut.It is understood that offer, which was rejected by the unions representing check-in staff, has been accepted by other parts of British Airways' (BA) business, including by ground operations, engineering and cabin crew workers.In a year of chaos, there are signs that British Airways really wants to avoid further disruption.Ground staff at Heathrow want their pay restored to the level it was at before the pandemic.It looks as though the threat of strikes over the summer has proved fruitful.BA's offer to compromise could have repercussions throughout the company.That is because, with the cost of living rising fast, workers in other parts of the business are already turning their attention to future pay deals.In the past, BA has often been willing to play hardball with its staff, risking strikes to keep costs down.But if that is no longer the case, employees might feel empowered to raise their demands.Tens of thousands of passengers have been hit by airport disruption and flight cancellations in recent weeks.Hundreds of flights across the UK were cancelled during the week of the Platinum Jubilee and school half-term holidays, and concerns have been raised of further travel woes during the summer.The disruption has been caused by factors including staff shortages that have left the aviation industry struggling to cope with resurgent demand for overseas travel.On Wednesday, BA announced it was cutting 10,300 more short-haul flights due to feature in its schedule between August and the end of October.Nearly 30,000 flights have been removed from BA's schedule between April and October this year.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Monster, Keep Your Head Up and Breaking News all featured on the posthumous 2010 compilation album Michael.They have since been the subject of a court case brought by a fan, who claims the vocals are by a session singer.Sony Music and Jackson's estate said their removal from streaming sites had nothing to do with their authenticity.In a statement, they described the action as "the simplest and best way to move beyond the conversation associated with these tracks once and for all". They continued: "The focus remains where it belongs - on the exciting new and existing projects celebrating Michael Jackson's legacy", including the Broadway musical MJ and a recently-announced biopic."The album's remaining tracks remain available," the statement concluded. "Nothing should be read into this action concerning the authenticity of the tracks - it is just time to move beyond the distraction surrounding them."Released in 2010, Michael was the first album of outtakes and unreleased music to emerge after Jackson's death from an overdose of propofol in 2009.Even before it hit the shops, the star's family were raising doubts over whether he had performed on all of the songs."I tried so hard to prevent this craziness, but they wouldn't listen," Sony responded with a statement saying it had "complete confidence in the results of our extensive research, as well as the accounts of those who were in the studio with Michael, that the vocals… are his own."When it was released, the back cover of the Michael album said: "This album contains nine previously unreleased vocal tracks performed by Michael Jackson. These tracks were recently completed using music from the original vocal tracks and music created by the credited producers."However, after hearing the music, fans were suspicious about three songs, in particular.The official story is that Jackson wrote and recorded them with the production team Edward Cascio and James Porte in 2007. Yet rumours persisted that the vocals were provided by an American singer called Jason Malachi, who apparently took credit for them in a 2011 Facebook post. (His manager later denied this, claiming the post was faked.)Then, in 2014, Jackson fan Vera Serova filed a class-action lawsuit against Cascio, Porte, Sony Music, Jackson estate co-executor John Branca, MJJ Productions (the estate's music arm) and Angelikson Productions (Cascio's production company).She accused them all of selling her and others a product that had been misrepresented. Separately, she accused Porte, Cascio and Angelikson of conducting an "elaborate artistic fraud" when they sold their tracks to Jackson's estate for millions of dollars.Jackson's estate and Sony denied the allegations, and an appeals court ultimately ruled in their favour, removing them from the lawsuit. "Because [they] lacked actual knowledge of the identity of the lead singer on [Breaking News, Monster and Keep Your Head Up], they could only draw a conclusion about that issue from their own research and the available evidence," court documents read. In that light, judges concluded, any claims made on the album cover or in promotional materials "amounted to a statement of opinion rather than fact".Serova's case against Angelikson Productions, Cascio and Porte is ongoing. She has also petitioned California's Supreme Court to revive the lawsuit against Sony, while the company has asked for the earlier ruling to be upheld.None of the legal action has, to date, established the origin of the contested songs. Fans can no longer judge for themselves, as they have disappeared from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and other streaming platforms  - although unofficial uploads can still be found.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Conservative councillor Daniel Cook told Channel 4 News Mr Pincher, who has been suspended by the Tory party, had groped him in 2005 and 2006.Mr Cook, deputy mayor at Tamworth council in Staffordshire, where Mr Pincher is an MP, said he had lodged a complaint with the Conservative Party. Channel 4 reported that Mr Pincher denies the latest allegations.He has been contacted by the BBC for a response. Former council leader Mr Cook, who waived his anonymity for his interview, said he felt angry at what had happened and wanted Mr Pincher expelled from the Tory party.Allegations emerged last week that Prime Minister Boris Johnson then faced questions He apologised on Tuesday for appointing Mr Pincher to the government role, admitting he had been told about a complaint in 2019 and saying he had made a "bad mistake".That triggered a swathe of resignations in government including Boris Johnson has now announced his resignation as Conservative leader.Mr Pincher is facing a string of claims of inappropriate behaviour stretching back several years, which he has denied.Two police forces Neither investigation resulted in any action and Mr Pincher denies the allegations.Mr Cook said he had met Mr Pincher when he had first started in politics as a council candidate in Tamworth for the 2004 elections aged about 28.He campaigned with Mr Pincher, among others, and Mr Cook said the parliamentary candidate had taken him under his wing.The councillor told Channel 4 Mr Pincher had been drunk on both occasions when he had been assaulted.Mr Cook said that in 2005, while his wife had been at work, Mr Pincher had come to his house with a council colleague and had "cupped his hand around my genitals" and had then asked if he had any "good porn".A year later, he said, Mr Pincher had again gone round to his house "stinking drunk", had cupped him again and grabbed him from behind.Mr Pincher made reference to his fellow Conservative being "a rising star" of politics in Tamworth, the councillor said.Mr Cook said he had reacted the first time by laughing it off and pushing him away, but the second time had thrown him against a fridge and physically thrown him out of his house, watching him stagger down his drive.He said he felt angry about what had happened and had come forward after other allegations had been made. Mr Cook added if he had spoken out at the time, the matter could have been dealt with sooner.A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: "Mr Pincher's membership of the Conservative Party has been suspended pending investigation."

m_text : Civilians boarded minibuses on Wednesday morning as Russian forces advanced from the north and east.Mayor Vadym Lyakh said "we take people out every day" and "about 23,000 residents remain". "Many of the evacuees were taken by bus to the city of Dnipro, further west."He said the city, previously home to more than 100,000 people, "is well fortified". With Russian forces now controlling the nearby Luhansk region, UK defence intellligence says Slovyansk is likely to be the next focus of the fight for Donbas, the industrial area comprising Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian forces also continued shelling Mykolaiv, a strategic city in the south where Ukraine is blocking an advance on the port city of Odesa.This video can not be playedA Russian-Ukrainian family has been irrevocably split by the war, after a missile attack on Kyiv injured Russian-born Ekaterina Volkova and killed her Ukrainian husband.The BBC spoke to their relatives, who called the strike on an apartment block unforgivable. Ekaterina and her daughter Zhenya were pulled from the rubble, but Oleksiy died, leaving the family grief-stricken. Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has told the BBC she is investigating more than 21,000 war crimes and crimes of aggression allegedly committed since the start of Russia's invasion.She acknowledged that many trials would have to be held in absentia. Despite that, she said: "Russian militaries who decided to kill civilians, to torture civilians, to rape civilians, they should understand that it's only a question of time when they all will be in court".She said she was receiving reports of 200-300 war crimes a day.There has been international condemnation of Russian attacks on civilian areas. Ukrainians, as well as foreign journalists and aid workers, have documented atrocities by Russian troops, such as indiscriminate shelling of apartment blocks. Russia denies targeting civilians and accuses Ukraine of staging "provocations".A Russian court has ordered a suspension of Kazakh oil exports to Western markets for a month.Russia controls the Black Sea oil terminal at Novorossiisk, where tankers load up with oil sent via pipeline from the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) operates the pipeline and is appealing against the ruling. The court found "documentary violations" in the CPC's oil spill response plan. Several Western oil giants have stakes in the CPC, including Chevron and Mobil.Russia's oil and gas exports are now restricted under Western sanctions, so producers like Kazakhstan are much in demand.Kazakhstan provided 6% of EU oil imports in 2020, and Russia 29%, the EU Commission says. The CPC carries 80% of Kazakh oil exports to Europe.Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly refused to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk "people's republics" declared by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He has also suggested Kazakhstan could boost its oil exports to the EU.Latvia plans to reintroduce national military service, which it scrapped in 2007. For a transitional five years it will be voluntary, then compulsory - a system similar to Sweden's.The move, announced by Defence Minister Artis Pabriks, will bring Latvia into line with its Baltic neighbours Estonia, Lithuania and Finland, which have military conscription.Men aged 18-27 will be recruited and paid up to €400 (£342; $408) a month, for 11 months of duty. Their service will also turn them into military reservists. Service will remain voluntary for women.Latvia, a member of both the EU and Nato, has just 7,500 active duty soldiers and National Guards, backed by 1,500 Nato troops. The goal is to train an extra 7,000 conscripts annually."The greater the number of people with military training, the less likely it will be that Russia will want to direct its military aggression against Latvia," Mr Pabriks tweeted.Latvia has a population of about 1.8 million, a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedThe PM was met with cheers from family and staff as he made his resignation speech outside No 10.He said he had tried to persuade colleagues it would be "eccentric" to change leader and blamed the "herd instinct" in Westminster for his exit.He said a timetable for a leadership contest would be announced next week. The winner of that contest will become the next UK prime minister.Mr Johnson faced a mass revolt by ministers over his leadership, sparked by the dramatic resignation of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday evening. He resisted calls to quit - including from newly-appointed Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi - for 48 hours until it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his party and could not continue.Speaking outside Downing Street, he said: "The reason I have fought so hard in the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person, was not just because I wanted to do so, because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you to do what we promised in 2019.""I regret not to have been successful in those arguments," he said but acknowledged that the will of his party was "clear"."In politics, no one is remotely indispensable," he said adding: "I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks."He said he was proud of his achievements in office citing taking the UK out of the EU, the government's response to Covid and rolling out the vaccine programme. He also said he had led "the West in standing up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine".Addressing the Ukrainian people he said: "We in the UK will continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes."President Volodymyr Zelensky praised Mr Johnson for "realising the threat of RF[Russian Federation] monster and always being at the forefront of supporting [Ukraine]."Mr Johnson thanked his wife Carrie and their children as well as the staff of Downing Street and "you, the British people for the immense privilege you have given me"."I know even if things can sometimes seem dark now our future together is golden."He promised that he and his cabinet would to serve the country's interest until a new leader is chosen. Mr Johnson came to power in July 2019 and six months later won a massive majority in a general election.However, he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws and his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher.The PM's speech was brief. But his departure from office won't necessarily be swift.He wanted history to know his resignation was the fault of colleagues and not himself. The "herd", as he called it, had moved quickly, despite winning the biggest majority at the 2019 general election since 1987 and attracting new voters to his party.The subtext is that the coalition of voters - including former Labour supporters - he assembled in 2019 may break up without him to keep it together.He referenced the bad press he received recently, but didn't spend long on any of the mistakes he may have made in office and which provoked mass resignations and a vote of no confidence.He simply acknowledged he hadn't persuaded colleagues that he should remain in office.He will stay on until a new leader is elected, but it is the backbench 1922 committee that will decide the timetable and some MPs want it expedited so he is not still in office until the autumn.With new cabinet ministers in place, he does not seem in a hurry to leave. He will want a legacy that isn't obscured by the chaotic past few days.The Conservative Party will now hold a leadership contest to find a replacement for the departing leader.Attorney General Suella Braverman has said she would "put my name into the ring" and MP Steve Baker have both indicated they will run, with more expected to follow.Some Conservative MPs have expressed concern Mr Johnson would stay in office until the autumn with one saying he had lost "the trust and authority required to continue".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : It is becoming a discovery machine like no other.Stars, asteroids and distant, bright galaxies - anything that can be visibly pinpointed is having its vital statistics measured by the observatory.Gaia has already mapped the positions of nearly two billion objects. Now, it can reveal more about their make-up."Essentially, previously, we could say very precisely where they are; now we can say what they are," Prof Nick Walton, from Cambridge University and a member of the Gaia science team, told BBC News.The European Space Agency's (Esa) Gaia satellite was launched in 2013 and placed a million miles from Earth. It looks a bit like a spinning top hat. And as it rotates, the telescope uses its This is especially important when trying to measure distances to objects, which Gaia achieves by tracking how these targets wobble ever so slightly on the sky as it circles the Sun - a neat form of trigonometry that has now been practised on 1.8 billion stars in, or very near, our Milky Way galaxy. The new data dump reveals spectroscopy information as well.Spectroscopy slices the light coming from stars into its constituent colours, to reveal the chemistry, temperature, mass, age and velocity of the targets under study.And for an important subset of stars - some 33 million - it has allowed Gaia scientists to determine how quickly these objects are moving towards or away from Earth. Combined with their previously established movement across the sky, this means we now have their full three-dimensional behaviour. Such information will give researchers even keener insights on how the Milky Way galaxy is structured and is evolving - from the past, into the future.And with some of these 3D stars also mapped in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, we should have a better idea of how and precisely when its mass will merge with the Milky Way - something expected in the next few billion years.One of the most surprising discoveries coming out of the new data is the recognition that Gaia can do so-called asteroseismology. This is the study of stars' subtle surface resonances, which enable scientists to pull out information such as how big a star is and how old it is."Starquakes teach us a lot about stars, notably their internal workings. Gaia is opening a goldmine for asteroseismology of massive stars," said Prof Conny Aerts from Belgium's KU Leuven.  Whenever Gaia drops its latest dataset (and this is the third full release), it is immediately mined by astronomy groups around the world.Some of these teams have scholarly papers ready to publish and just need Gaia's numbers to complete their projects. For competing groups, it will be a race to see who can publish first.  Hot topics will include the search for high-velocity stars, which move at hundreds of kilometres per second. "The most likely scenario for how these stars are getting such high velocities is that they must have been close to our galactic centre, which has the physics to produce these accelerations," Esa's Gaia project scientist Dr Timo Prusti said. "So far, these stars have been more like candidates, because the Gaia accuracy has not been sufficient [to fully understand them], but I'm sure astronomers will be ready with their queries to attack the new Gaia data."Other hot topics ready to be mined include whether stars are enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, or depleted. The low "metallicity" stars are the more fascinating because they are probably very old, perhaps in the first group that came together to form the Milky Way.The Gaia telescope mission may have launched just over eight years ago but Monday's data release represents only the first 34 months of its science operations. A further five years of gathered data has yet to be fully processed. And with Gaia expected to keep scanning the sky until 2025, it could be the end of the decade or even the early 2030s before all of its information is put in the public domain."What do you get from that extra time? Well, it bashes down uncertainties for one thing. But the main advantage is in increasing your sensitivity to things that are changing," Prof Gerry Gilmore, from Cambridge University, told BBC News."In particular, this is true for the oscillations of stars that tell us there are planets moving around them. "If you've only got one year of data, you can only find planets that are very, very close to their stars. "But after 10 years of observations, you will find planets far from their parent star, indeed families of planets."By the end of its mission, Gaia could have identified tens of thousands of planets in the Milky Way.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Scandals that would have sunk other politicians appeared to have no effect on him. He was always able to bounce back. His gaffes and blunders became part of his brand. In an age of boring, machine-like politicians, he was seen as a "character", his unruly mop of blond hair and bumbling persona instantly recognisable even to those with no interest in politics. His fun-loving, relentlessly upbeat image, allied to formidable campaigning skills, helped him reach parts of the electorate more conventional Conservatives could not.He won two terms as mayor of London, normally a Labour stronghold, and helped convince millions to back Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum.He became prime minister in July 2019 without an election - but four months later secured an historic landslide victory, winning seats in parts of the country that had never voted Conservative before. As 2020 dawned, his dominance of British politics appeared to be complete. But then came coronavirus.A global pandemic would have tested any leader and Johnson's government made its share of mistakes, with the UK at one point having the highest death rate in the developed world.But, in the end, it was not his handling of coronavirus that led to his downfall. It was, rather, questions about his character and fitness for high office.To some long-time observers of Johnson's career, this did not come as a surprise. In From his earliest days, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson had a tendency to believe rules were for other people. "Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility," his teacher Martin Hammond wrote of the 17-year-old Boris. "I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else."His unwavering self-belief, however, left an impression."Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating," Simon Veksner, a school friend, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums.He won a scholarship to Eton, arguably England's most prestigious private school, where he discovered a love of Classics and began developing the persona that would become so familiar in his later life.Oxford University followed, where he achieved his ambition of becoming president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823, and the time-honoured training ground for Conservative politicians. He also joined the infamous Bullingdon Club, known for the rowdy, drunken behaviour of its members, which included future prime minister David Cameron.He left Oxford and was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but lost his job after falsifying a quote - an incident he would later describe as his "biggest cock-up". It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given work by then-editor of the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings.As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson set about ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. It was, Disaster loomed again, however, when a recording surfaced of a telephone call between Johnson and his old Oxford friend, Darius Guppy, who had been demanding the private address of a News of the World journalist.The tape suggested Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though Guppy, who was later jailed for fraud, had indicated he had wanted to have the reporter, who had been investigating his affairs, beaten up.Hastings confronted him about the recording, which had been sent anonymously to the Telegraph, but after an apology, with Johnson deploying, in Hastings' words, "all of his self-parodying skills as a waffler", he was sent back to Brussels with a rebuke.In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament.With the Tories languishing in opposition, then-leader Michael Howard was keen to harness the star power of the new MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.But Mr Johnson's career as a frontbencher was short-lived.In 2004, Mr Howard ordered him to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city over a Spectator article that had attributed some of the blame for the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of the city's football fans. He survived "Operation Scouse Grovel", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.Within a year he was back on the frontbench, under new Tory leader David Cameron. But he was increasingly seen as comedian and TV personality, rather than a serious candidate for power.He had to wait until 2007 to get a chance to move up the ladder, when a somewhat trepidatious Cameron selected him as the Conservative candidate for London mayor. Johnson surprised everybody by storming to victory over Labour's Ken Livingstone, who had looked unbeatable, and winning again four years later. As mayor, Mr Johnson scrapped the unpopular "bendy buses", implemented a bike hire scheme (colloquially known to Londoners as "Boris bikes") and oversaw arrangements for the 2012 London Olympics - leading to one of the more infamous images of his political career, as he dangled from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags.In early 2016, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a "career psychopath".Johnson deployed all of his formidable campaigning skills, although he came in for heavy criticism for the claim - printed on the side of a battlebus - that the UK sent the EU £350m a week, which did not take into account the UK's rebate.When his side emerged victorious, it was inevitable that Mr Johnson would throw his hat into the ring to replace the outgoing David Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. It was a brutal political assassination, met with dismay by Johnson's supporters.Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.His opponents had a field day trawling the archives for past gaffes and indiscretions, which included a 2007 newspaper column describing then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as looking like a "sadistic nurse in a mental hospital". He had also been forced to say sorry to Papua New Guinea over a reference to "orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing" and, going further back, had apologised for using an racial slur when writing about the Queen's tours of Commonwealth countries.During his tenure at the Foreign Office, Johnson supported a tough line against Russia and expelled 23 diplomats following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal. He also attracted criticism when he mistakenly said Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the aid worker imprisoned in Iran, had been working as a journalist.In 2018, he quit the cabinet in protest at Theresa May's Brexit deal, arguing it would lead Britain into "the status of a colony". He returned to his former highly paid job as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, immediately running into controversy and accusations of Islamophobia after writing that Muslim women wearing burkas "look like letter boxes".He remained a stern critic of May from the backbenches and, when she was forced to resign, he once again ran to be leader of his party. This time he was successful, building a commanding lead, not only with Conservative party members - with whom he had always been popular - but, critically, with Tory MPs.His first few months in the role proved to be rocky as he struggled to govern with his party's at first tiny, then non-existent majority in the House of Commons.He recruited Dominic Cummings - regarded with suspicion and seen as a troublemaker by many Conservatives - as his closest Downing Street aide. At Cummings' behest, he fought a guerrilla war against those MPs seeking to block his Brexit strategy, including some high-profile members of his own party.In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to "Get Brexit Done", a slogan dreamed up by Cummings.The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.In a dramatic televised statement, he announced a national lockdown, a move unprecedented in peace time. The self-proclaimed libertarian and champion of the free market was now ordering the nation to stay in their homes, shutting down of huge of swathes of the UK economy and promising to spend billions on subsidising the wages of furloughed workers.In April 2020, Johnson tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted "it could have gone either way".Less than three weeks later, his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth to their first child, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson - Nicholas in a tribute to the doctors who had treated him in hospital.The twice-divorced prime minister married Ms Symonds at Westminster Cathedral at the end of May 2020. Their daughter Romy was born in December 2021. Ms Symonds was a well-connected figure behind the scenes in the Conservative Party and her influence came to be resented by Mr Cummings and his close-knit team of former Vote Leave officials, who were now at the heart of the Downing Street machine.As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world, helping the UK economy to re-open earlier than most. The mass unemployment predicted by many had also been avoided. But his political problems were beginning to mount up.Back in May 2020, he had stood by Dominic Cummings when he came under fire over a lockdown-busting trip to County Durham. But Mr Cummings was forced out of Downing Street at the end of that year after losing a power struggle with Carrie Symonds, and now appeared determined to remove him from office. In an explosive appearance before a select committee, Mr Cummings said Mr Johnson was "unfit for the job" of prime minister, and that thousands of people had died needlessly because he had delayed lockdowns and ignored scientific advice.Johnson was also under investigation over an expensive designer revamp of the Downing Street flat where he lived with his family, which was initially paid for by a Conservative donor. He was ultimately cleared by his ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, but the peer later rebuked his boss for having "insufficient" respect for his role, after new information came to light that had not been revealed to his inquiry. Lord Geidt would later quit the role in exasperation at the prime minister's attitude to ministerial standards.Mr Johnson's political opponents, who had been unable to lay a glove on him at the height of the pandemic, were now making hay with accusations of sleaze and cronyism, and a prime minister with an apparently cavalier disregard for long-established rules of behaviour. This impression was not helped by Johnson's attempt to rewrite the disciplinary code for MPs to help his ally Owen Paterson, who was facing suspension for breaking lobbying rules. Johnson later confessed this had been a "total mistake".But worse was to come in November 2021, when the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police over lockdown parties, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.He faced an investigation by a Commons committee into whether he had misled Parliament with his initial claims that there had been no parties in Downing Street. The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. Booing was heard when Johnson and his wife arrived for the Platinum Jubilee thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral.He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite 41% of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to "get on with the job" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.The rollercoaster career of a politician who had defied political gravity for nearly four decades has finally come crashing to earth.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Umm Ali carefully boils a pot of water to cook dinner for her seven children. She feeds the fire with scraps of cardboard and rubbish, whatever she can find to keep the flames going. The meal she makes is small and basic, because here at the Al-Sadaqah camp, in the Idlib countryside, supplies are scarce. She's thankful for the food aid she receives, but even that isn't enough. "Every day the kids go to the landfill to collect aluminium cans, nylon bags and iron. They sell them for a pittance, it's just enough to buy four packets of bread. That's only enough for one meal, our breakfast," she says.The UN says the number of Syrians in need is higher now than at any point during the 11-year civil war, as the toxic mix of years of fighting, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have devastated the country's economy. The World Food Programme (WFP) says the cost of food has risen by 800% in just two years. At a Turkish compound just a few kilometres from the border, lorries are loaded with humanitarian aid. It could be anything from food to temporary shelters, or vital medicines. Hakim Froissart is logistics officer for the WFP in southern Turkey, one of the key people who keeps things running smoothly. "We're waiting for the vote, we don't know what will happen," he says. "If there is no resolution we don't have any mandate to operate any more. So we would have to stop the operations. And we would have to find a solution. But there's no-one who can take over," he adds. Part of the reason for that is the sheer logistical effort needed here. Around 1,000 loaded lorries make the journey across the border every month. In the last few weeks there have been more than usual. Aid agencies have been so concerned about the potential of the crossing being closed that they have been sending extra shipments to build up a small surplus on the other side. The process is well practised and fast. Two rows of lorries line up back to back. One is Turkish, the other Syrian. They pull together until they're touching, and piles of cardboard boxes are pushed from one into the other, ready to be transported to the border and beyond. The whole cross-border operation only exists because of a UN mandate which allows it to happen without the permission of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's ally. The north-west of the country is outside his control, in the hands of the jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Turkish-backed rebel groups. The Syrian regime has only facilitated a small amount of what is called "cross-line" aid. That means it crosses the front lines within a country, rather than international borders. WFP food aid that has come via Damascus has fed less than 50,000 people. From the hub at the Turkish crossing, the UN and its partners sustain 1.4 million. Despite that, Russia believes President Assad's sovereignty takes precedence, and that the job of providing aid should lie in Syrian hands.Bab al-Hawa is the only aid route left. There used to be others, allowing lorries to arrive in Syria from Iraq and Jordan. But Russia already used its veto to close them down. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council - along with the UK, US, France and China - it can block any mandate it chooses. Just a few months ago, it rejected a resolution that condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and called for a withdrawal of troops.Exactly a year ago, there were again fears that the Bab al-Hawa crossing would be closed. But this time around the story is not only about Syria. The vote in New York comes just days before US President Joe Biden's headline visit to the Middle East. It risks highlighting starkly how much influence the US has lost to Russia in the region. In 2021, last-minute, high-level diplomacy between Mr Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin kept the aid route open. But a lot has happened in the last 12 months. US-Russia relations are at their lowest ebb for decades, fractured further by the war in Ukraine, and it will be far harder than last year to crack those vital negotiations. Alyssa is an inspector at the UN hub on the Turkish side of the border, and as the lorries are prepared she carefully slices through the tape holding one of the food boxes closed. Everything has to be checked, to make sure it's purely for humanitarian purposes. She unpacks bags of bulgur wheat, lentils and chickpeas, rolling them in her hands to check there are no cuts or signs of re-sealing. Once the precious cargo is authorised the lorries are sealed and weighed, and sent on their way.  At the Bab al-Hawa crossing they pass straight through, without being stopped like most other vehicles. When they drive under the golden dome-topped arches of Gate Zero, they are on Syrian soil. Once they arrive at their destination aid agencies unpack the food and distribute it to displaced families. This is a long conflict, and many people here have been living in makeshift tents for more than a decade. Children were born here and are being raised here. The tattered canvas tents of the displacement camps are the only home they have ever known.Janne Suvanto, the WFP's Emergency Co-ordinator in north-west Syria, says an end to the last cross-border aid transfers would be devastating. "I think it's a personal tragedy," he tells me.   "The good thing is that we've prepared a three-month buffer of food supplies. But people have used their coping mechanisms already. We know people are cutting their rations and quality of food. "I think we can quite confidently say that there would be more preventable deaths if this border crossing is closed. Irrespective of any political viewpoints, it's important that we have humanitarian principles at front of mind."Umm Ali's cramped tent in Idlib is a long way from New York, where the Security Council vote will take place. Her life, a daily battle to survive and protect her children, is far removed from quiet conversations and hushed diplomacy in UN corridors. But decisions made thousands of kilometres away by some of the world's most powerful men and women have a direct and sizeable impact on her life. "Of course we consider it something important and crucial, because we don't have money or work to secure food here," she says. Umm Ali hopes diplomats in New York will remember her when they are making their choices.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Now, the prime minister has lost the support of his MPs and is set to resign. How did it come to this?On Wednesday 29 June, the MP Chris Pincher - at the time, the Conservative deputy chief whip - went to a private members' club in London. In his words, he "drank far too much" He was accused of groping two men, which led to a flurry of allegations, some dating back years. It set off a chain of events that ended with the prime minister's downfall.First, Downing Street said Mr Johnson was not aware of "specific allegations" about Mr Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip in February. Ministers later reiterated this line - even though it turned out to be inaccurate.On 4 July, the BBC reported Mr Johnson had been aware of a formal complaint. The next day, a former civil servant - Lord McDonald - said the prime minister had been told of the complaint in person.Mr Johnson then admitted he had been told in 2019, and apologised for appointing Mr Pincher as deputy chief whip.This video can not be playedIn April this year, the prime minister was He also apologised for going to a "bring your own booze" party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown.More widely, the Metropolitan Police issued 126 fines to 83 people for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall.And a report by Sue Gray - a senior civil servant - described a series of social events by political staff that "The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture," she wrote.Last December, Mr Johnson told the Commons that "all guidance was followed completely in No 10". He is now being investigated by a Commons committee over Inflation has risen sharply in 2022, Many of the reasons were outside of Boris Johnson's control. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, has led to rises in oil prices and the cost of food.And, while the government has taken some steps - for example, by cutting fuel duty by 5p per litre - it also went ahead The government said the tax rise would pay for health and social care, and changes that kicked in this week "In the middle of the worst cost of living crisis for decades," said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in April, "the government chooses to increase taxes on working people".In October 2021, a House of Commons committee recommended a 30-day suspension for then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson. The committee said he broke lobbying rules, to try to benefit companies who paid him.But the Conservatives - led by the prime minister - After an outcry, This video can not be playedBoris Johnson won his thumping majority on the back of a clear, easy-to-follow policy - Get Brexit Done.But since then, his critics said, there was a lack of focus and ideas in Downing Street.His ex-adviser turned chief critic, Dominic Cummings, repeatedly accused him of being an out-of-control shopping trolley, veering from position to position.Others questioned the prime minister's philosophy - or, indeed, if he had one. In June, Conservative MP and former minister Jeremy Hunt accused Mr Johnson of lacking Mr Hunt was speaking before a confidence vote, which Mr Johnson won - but the complaints were getting louder. The But that, now, is not the concern of Conservative MPs. They have spoken, and the prime minister is going.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The Norwegian labour ministry confirmed it had stepped in to end industrial action set for later this week."Workers are going back to work as soon as possible. We are cancelling the planned escalation," Lederne union leader Audun Ingvartsen told Reuters.The Department for Business had insisted: "The UK has no issues with gas supply."The UK imports about 50% of its gas and Norway is its biggest supplier making up 77% of imports, ONS data shows.Oil and gas from Norway, Europe's second-largest energy supplier after Russia, is in high demand as many countries reduce their dependence on Russian supplies in response to the war in Ukraine.The industrial action started on Monday following a pay dispute between the employer's organisation, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, and the union Lederne, which represents oil and gas workers. The first phase forced the Norwegian energy company Equinor to shut down three of its oil and gas fields. More strikes were expected on Tuesday evening, impacting three more Equinor facilities.The union had threatened to take further strike action from Saturday if the dispute was not resolved. But labour minister, Marte Mjoes Persen, told Reuters the government had exercised its right to intervene."Norway plays a vital role in supplying gas to Europe, and the planned escalation [of the strike] would have had serious consequences, for Britain, Germany and other nations," he said."The volume impact would have been dramatic in light of the current European situation."Reacting to the strike being called off, NOG, the oil lobby, said in a statement: "We are glad to see that the government understood the seriousness of the situation and acted to uphold Norway's reputation as a reliable and stable supplier of natural gas to Europe."Norwegian gas arrives in the UK at two terminals - Easington in Yorkshire and St Fergus in Scotland.It was Saturday's planned strike that would have affected UK supplies as it would have temporarily closed the Sleipner field - a key distribution point for gas exports to the UK.Norwegian-state owned Gassco had told the BBC "in a worst case scenario, from this Saturday there will be zero deliveries to Easington", a gas terminal on the East Yorkshire coast, But while the potential strike action would only have impacted the operations at Easington, Gassco said that was by far the most significant of the two, receiving 80% to 90% of the gas from Norway. The Department for Business said: "We have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world, with access to our own North Sea gas reserves, and the second largest LNG port infrastructure in Europe."Gassco transports gas to other European countries including Germany and Belgium. It's thought strike action would have prevented up to 170 million cubic litres of gas from being delivered, around 50% of the total daily delivery amount from the company.

m_text : Parts of Sydney have received about eight months of rain in four days.Roads have been cut off, some houses are under water and thousands have been left without power.Widespread flooding across Australia - driven by a La Niña weather pattern - has killed more than 20 people this year, many in New South Wales (NSW). More than 100 evacuation orders have been issued across Greater Sydney for the current emergency.People in another 50 areas have been warned to prepare to leave, as several major rivers flood. Severe weather is also hitting the nearby Hunter and Illawarra regions.Some areas of NSW have seen 800mm of rain in four days, says the Bureau of Meteorology, almost a third more than the average rainfall Greater London receives in a year.The downpour is expected to begin easing in Sydney on Tuesday, but gale-force winds are also forecast, bringing a risk of falling trees and powerlines."The emergency is far from over," NSW Emergency Services Minister Stephanie Cooke said.This video can not be playedAuthorities are urging locals to heed evacuation warnings, after rescuers were called to save people who were ordered to leave two days earlier."Ultimately if you stay you're putting your life at risk," said NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet.For many locals, it is their third flood this year.Speaking after evacuating his partner from their house by kayak, Tyler Cassel said locals were tired of the constant threat to their homes and lives.He moved into his home in the Sydney suburb of Windsor last year, and was told major flood events were supposed to be "one in 25 years, one in 50 years or whatever it was"."Now it has been three in 2022," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."We've become experts around this area now... you are almost living on the edge."Experts say the flooding emergency has been worsened by climate change and a La Niña weather phenomenon. A La Niña develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards Indonesia. In their place, colder waters come up to the surface.In Australia, a La Niña increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones and cooler daytime temperatures.This video can not be playedPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : There is the urge to breathe out. Just one big exhalation to relieve the pressure. But Ivan knows it will be the death of him if he does. The temperature is just above freezing. Warm breath rising into cold air will create a small fog and alert the killers. They are already checking the bodies of the men they have just shot, making sure, firing a final bullet where they see any sign of life. He hears one of the Russians say: "That one is still alive!" Ivan wonders if they are talking about him? Maybe it is one of the others. Still, he prepares himself for the bullet. He is already bleeding from a wound in his side. The other Russian says: "He will die by himself!"But then there is a shot. It strikes somebody else. A man fights different urges in such moments. The bullet wound in his side is agonisingly painful. But crying out would be fatal. All of this will come back later in dreams. But for now, he will lie among the dead. He will be as still as his murdered comrades.  I meet Ivan Skyba in a small village in rural Poland where he has found shelter for his family. He has a job. The kids are living in a place without fear. The warm weather has arrived and in the evenings the family walk to a local park where Ivan fishes in the lake. The bruises on his face and body have healed. But at night, after everybody else is asleep, the wounds of memory are open. Ivan Skyba is the man who came back from the dead.When it all started in the early hours of 24 February, Ivan was driving his taxi in Kyiv. He heard explosions. Ivan struggled to believe it was actually happening. "I didn't imagine it coming," he says.The dispatcher called and said all taxis were to return to base. Forty-three year old Ivan had been doing whatever work he could find to support his wife and four children. He drove the cab and sometimes worked as a building renovator. His first thought that morning was to get the family's identification documents. If they were going to have to flee, they needed passports. He quickly drove the 40km towards Brovary where they lived - and from there to Bucha where his wife and children were visiting her mother. That was where the family would stay until they could make a plan. "Different rumours were circulating that [the Russians] were approaching Bucha. We started arranging shelters in the cellars, bringing things there."Three days later, on 27 February, the Russians arrived nearby. Almost immediately they suffered a devastating ambush by Ukrainian artillery. A column of Russian airborne troops had taken up position on Vokzalna Street when the shells came screaming in. They retreated temporarily. But they were angry, convinced some locals had told the Ukrainian military of their location.By now, across Ukraine, people were mobilising to defend their communities. Bucha was no exception. Ivan Skyba and his friend, Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather to his two-year-old daughter Zlata, heard that some men who had fought in the eastern Donbas region against the Russian-backed separatists were forming in Bucha a unit of Ukraine's Territorial Defence Force, a militia to protect local communities in time of war. The two men joined up."We were doing duty at checkpoints, checking documents and making sure people didn't carry arms," says Ivan. "We were helping to organise people's safe passage out because we knew the area." Ivan's unit was poorly armed. They had one rifle, a grenade and a pair of binoculars to share among nine men. He and his comrades worked shifts on a checkpoint on Yablunska Street. In Ukrainian it means "the street of the apples", because of the trees that line much of its nearly 6km length. In peacetime, it is a pleasant place with a lake for fishing. Some of the houses back on to fields and orchards. It is also the site of an old office complex, built in the Soviet era, part of which has been transformed into workspaces for local businesses. These quarters at 144 Yablunska Street would become a Russian base notorious in the story of the war's brutality.By early March, Ukrainians were fleeing the country in their hundreds of thousands. Ivan and his wife decided the family should try to shelter in Bucha for the time being. He describes the atmosphere among the men as one of defiance. "There was no fear. No fear. There was a desire to unite, to get together. We were on our feet all the time. When we were off duty, we would distribute food around cellars to those who were taking shelter there, the women and children. There was no time to be afraid."That changed dramatically on 3 March. The Russians returned in force "in the second half of the day, around lunchtime".Immediately, Ivan and the others began directing cars away from the direction of the Russian advance. There was indiscriminate firing. Rockets were landing. He saw a white Renault being struck and a woman and her children trapped inside the burning car. There were eight men at Ivan's checkpoint and with the Russians rapidly approaching they decided to try to hide. Directly opposite the checkpoint, at number 31 Yablunska Street, was Valera Kotenko's house. The 53-year-old had given them hot drinks and food. He offered shelter now. Soon the Russians were outside."We could hear them and the movement of their equipment. We were surrounded," says Ivan. The men whispered to each other. They could not run. The Russians had thermal imaging detectors that would surely pick up any attempt to escape at night. The men had already ditched their few weapons and now decided on a cover story - if the Russians found them they would say they were builders working in the district and had been sheltering from the fighting.They texted wives and girlfriends. One of the men, Anatoliy Prykhidko, aged 39, called his wife Olha that evening - 3 March - and whispered "that he couldn't speak because he could be heard. It was so quiet. He said they were in hiding."The following morning, Yulia, the wife of Andriy Dvornikov, a delivery driver, received a message saying: "We have been encircled, we are sitting here, but I will be getting away from here as soon as there is an opportunity." He told her to delete all messages and photographs from her phone. And he told her that he loved her. With tears streaming down her face, Olha Prykhidko, tells me of her last communication from Anatoliy on the morning of 4 March: "At 10:00, he sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message."Less than an hour later the Russians broke in. Ivan Skyba remembers beatings and shouted questions. Mobile phones and shoes were confiscated. By 11:00 two different sets of CCTV images captured the men being led across and then down Yablunska Street towards number 144. Each had one hand on the belt of the man in front and the other on their own head. They were lined up against a wall next to the Russian base and made to kneel. The Russians forced their shirts and sweaters over their heads so that they could not see . They were beaten with rifle butts and verbally abused. According to Ivan they shouted: "You are the Bandera fighters (an anti-Soviet nationalist group in World War Two). You wanted to burn us with Molotov cocktails! We'll burn you alive now!"This video can not be playedIvan says the Russians decided to intimidate the others by shooting 28-year-old Vitaliy Karpenko, a worker at a co-operative store. After this, a younger man in the group panicked and told the Russians that all of them belonged to the Territorial Defence Unit. The beatings intensified.Ivan Skyba and another man, Andriy Verbovyi, a father of one and a woodworker, were brought into the building. In the interrogation that followed, Ivan had a bucket placed over his head and was made to bend and lean against the wall. Bricks were piled, one after the other on his back, until he collapsed. He was beaten again and a brick was repeatedly smashed against the bucket. At some point he heard the police tell Andriy Verbovyi that they would shoot him in the foot. There was a shot. After that he didn't hear Andriy any more.Ivan was then led back out of the building to join the other men. Some of what took place was witnessed by local residents who were ordered to gather by the Russians in front of number 144, but kept separate from the arrested men. Lucy Moskalenko remembers a Russian officer telling her to cover her daughters' eyes because they would see things they would never forget. "He told us, 'Don't look at those people lying on the ground. They are not humans. They are absolute dirt. Dirt. They are not human. They are beasts.'" Her sister, Irina Volynets, had accompanied Lucy. Both recall the noise of the Russian armoured vehicles, the sound of shelling, and how the dogs of the neighbourhood were fighting with each other. It was as if a madness had descended on the place.Then Irina had a shock. She saw that her old classmate, Andriy Verbovyi, the boy who had sat beside her from kindergarten, and all the way up through school, was lying bleeding on the ground. Only a few weeks before, they had walked home from the shopping centre together. There was a sheet thrown on the ground near him. "He was lying there, all twisted from cold. He was looking straight at me. We looked into each other's eyes," she says. Irina wanted to go and cover her old friend with the sheet, anything that might make him warmer. But she did not. "Was she too afraid?" I ask."It was not so much fear as despair," she replies, "and I was really confused at the time, and couldn't seem to grasp how it happened, and why my classmate was lying there on the ground." Everything was happening so fast. Besides, she had just seen that her son Slavyk was among the line of men. He had been captured separately and beaten, before being brought to join the others. Waiting in the line Slavyk saw blood on the ground nearby, and heard the Russians talking about a wounded man. This was almost certainly Andriy Verbovyi. "I heard them talk among themselves to finish him off because he wouldn't make it," recalls Slavyk. He began to fear for his own life.Irina found an officer and pleaded for Slavyk's life. The soldier listened. Then he called over a Ukrainian informer - possibly the arrested man who had cracked after the shooting of Vitaliy Karpenko - and asked him: "Is he one of them?""No," came the reply. Slavyk was released to his mother. The residents were told to go home, but Irina remembers an ominous feeling as she left. "I was afraid horrible things would happen."On the following day, 5 March, Andriy Verbovyi's wife, Natalya, sent him a message."Where are you? Your [good luck] chain is with me, the amulet as well. I am protecting you from all bad things. We are praying for you. We are waiting for your call. Write us at least two words." By then, Andriy was dead.Ivan Skyba sensed time was running out. By late afternoon on 4 March, two of the eight men captured with him had been shot dead. "The Russians started talking between themselves as to what they would do with us. The conversation was as follows: 'What shall we do with them?' The second man says, 'Finish them off, but just take them out, so that they wouldn't be lying here.'"The remaining men were led around the corner into a small courtyard. From under the edge of his clothing Ivan saw the body of a man lying on a small concrete platform. He had clearly been shot earlier. The Russians began taunting their victims. "They were enjoying the execution, using swear words, saying, "That's it. It's kapooey (death) for you!" Ivan recalls a final exchange of words with his comrades. "We said goodbye to each other. That was it." Among those to whom he bade farewell was Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather of his daughter.According to Ivan, Anatoliy Prykhidko suddenly decided to make a run for it but was shot straight away. Then the Russians opened fire on the others. "I felt a bullet go into my side," Ivan remembers. "It wounded me and I fell."Ivan cannot remember exactly how long the Russians stayed, but it was more like minutes than hours. When he sensed they were gone he risked a glance from under his jacket. The courtyard was empty of life. Now was his chance. He reached out towards a pair of feet near him - those of the dead man he had noticed when they first entered the courtyard. He pulled off the man's shoes to put on his own exposed feet. He then crawled to a fence and dragged himself across into nearby gardens. There was another fence to cross before he made it into a house abandoned by its owners during the shelling.What followed was another terrifying ordeal. Inside the house, Ivan treated his wound with some antiseptic liquid he found in the bathroom and changed into clothes left behind by the householder. He wrapped himself in a blanket and tried to sleep. But he was disturbed by voices. Russian voices. It turned out that several Russian soldiers were also resting in the house."They saw me and started asking me who I was and what I was doing there." He persuaded them that he was the owner of the house and that his family had been evacuated. His wounds, he explained, were the result of shelling. The soldiers believed his story but they told him he couldn't stay where he was. Instead, they said they would take him to their base for medical treatment. Back at 144 Yablunska Street. "I was terrified what would happen next - from one captivity into another."But Ivan's luck held. At the base, combat medics treated his wounds. If the troops who shot him were still around, they either did not see him return, or did not recognise him. He was placed with civilians sheltering in the bunker of the building. After several days, they were allowed to leave. The bodies of the murdered men who had been defending Bucha with Ivan were left lying in the courtyard, where the Russians dumped rubbish, for the remaining month of the occupation. Ivan found his family, still sheltering from the war, at home. They were able to flee Bucha, and eventually Ukraine into Poland, but not the legacy of the terrible hours at 144 Yablunska. Military defeat forced the retreat. Harried by Ukrainian forces the Russians pulled out of Bucha on 31 March and headed north to the border with Belarus.The invaders left behind numerous traces of their presence. From the banal - obscene graffiti scrawled on the walls - to the potentially significant. We found a soldier's military-issued debit card on the floor of 144 Yablunska, and traced him to Pskov in north-western Russia, a major base for airborne forces. Other journalists found evidence leading to the same units - the 104th and 234th Airborne Assault regiments.A Bucha resident found Ivan Skyba's mobile phone, left behind by the Russians as they retreated. It contained records of calls made to several numbers in Russia. The records don't link any of the callers directly to the massacre. The phone might easily have been passed around among a large group of soldiers. But the call records could help narrow down the search for perpetrators to smaller units within the regiments present when Ivan and the others were shot.The killings at 144 Yablunska Street and elsewhere in Bucha are the focus of a huge war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court and Ukraine. The Ukrainian investigation is led by a police lawyer who, until recently, was best known for investigating cases of brutality within the country's police force. Walking me around the crime scene, Yuriy Belousov is hopeful the perpetrators will ultimately face justice."These Russian soldiers who have committed this crime, they could be captured somewhere," he says, pointing to the recent trial of a Russian prisoner of war accused of murdering a civilian near Kyiv. But the big targets of the investigation are President Putin and the Russian military and political elite."It was planned in advance," Mr Belousov says. "It was instructed from the top how to behave. So the suspects would be top of the top, the guys who actually launch the war, let's say. It's like a chain of people whose decisions led to the invasion of Ukraine." Barring a change of regime in Moscow, any imminent prosecution seems highly unlikely.If there are prosecutions, Ivan Skyba will be a vital witness. For now, he works with the Polish man who has given the family shelter. The Russians seem physically far away. But there is the terror that comes at night. "You wake up because you are anticipating that shot in your head. I have this feeling. It comes like a wave."When we walk to a nearby lake in the evening, I notice that a teenaged boy has joined the family group. He plays with Ivan's son who is just a few years younger. Ivan tells me that the teenager is the child of his murdered friend and godfather to his daughter, Svyatoslav Turovsky. The boy and his mother moved to Poland with the Skyba family.It is a perfect early summer's evening - the boys fishing, Ivan leaning against a tree and looking on, his wife shepherding their young daughter away from the water's edge. But for Ivan and his family, for their friends the Turovskyis, for all the families of the men of 144 Yablunska, Russia's invasion and the massacre it unleashed has changed everything.I remember the words of Olha Prykhidko, whose husband Anatoliy tried to run for his life, and whose grave she visits every day with two cups of coffee, one for him and one for her.  "When no-one can hear me," she says, "I call him by his name." Day after day she calls to him, from silence to silence, into the emptiness made by war.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Washington has had a long-standing policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.China's President Xi Jinping has said "reunification" with Taiwan "China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of the country again. However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Taiwan is an island, roughly 100 miles from the coast of south east China.It sits in the so-called "first island chain", which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to US foreign policy. If China was to take over Taiwan, But China insists that its intentions are purely peaceful.Historical sources suggest that the island first came under full Chinese control in the 17th Century when the Qing dynasty began administering it. Then, in 1895, they gave up the island to Japan after losing the first Sino Japanese war. China took the island again in 1945 after Japan lost World War Two. But a civil war erupted in mainland China between nationalist government forces led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong's Communist Party.The communists won in 1949 and took control in Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and what was left of the nationalist party - known as the Kuomintang - fled to Taiwan, where they ruled for the next several decades. China points to this history to say that Taiwan was originally a Chinese province. But the Taiwanese point to the same history to argue that they were never part of the modern Chinese state that was first  formed after the revolution in 1911 - or the People's Republic of China that was established under Mao in 1949. The Kuomintang has been one of Taiwan's most prominent political parties ever since - ruling the island for a significant part of its history. Currently, only 13 countries (plus the Vatican) recognise Taiwan as a sovereign country.China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan, or to do anything which implies recognition.Taiwan's defence minister has said relations with China are the worst they have been for 40 years. China could attempt to bring about "reunification" by non-military means such as strengthening economic ties.But in any military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan. China spends more than any country except the US on defence and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks.Much of China's military power is focused elsewhere but, in overall terms of active duty personnel for example, there is a huge imbalance between the two sides.In an open conflict, That help could come from the US which sells arms to Taiwan.Until now, Washington's policy of "strategic ambiguity" has meant the US has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack.Diplomatically, the US currently sticks to the "One-China" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government - in Beijing - and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan.But in May, US president Joe Biden appeared to harden Washington's position.Asked whether the US would defend Taiwan militarily, Mr Biden replied: "Yes."He also drew a parallel between the possibility of a Chinese attack on Taiwan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine: "The idea that, that it [Taiwan] can be taken by force, just taken by force, is just not, is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine."In 2021, China appeared to ramp up pressure by sending military aircraft into Taiwan's Air Defence Zone, a self-declared area where foreign aircraft are identified, monitored, and controlled in the interests of national security.Taiwan made data on plane incursions public in 2020.The numbers of aircraft reported peaked in October 2021, with 56 incursions in a single day. Taiwan's economy is hugely important.Much of the world's everyday electronic equipment - from phones to laptops, watches and games consoles - is powered by computer chips made in Taiwan.By TSMC is a so-called "foundry" - a company which makes chips designed by consumer and military customers. It is a vast industry, worth almost $100bn (£730bn) in 2021.A Chinese takeover in Taiwan could give Beijing some control over one of the world's most important industries.Despite the recent tensions between China and Taiwan, research suggests that many Taiwanese people are relatively untroubled.In October the Almost two thirds (64.3%) replied that they did not.Separate research indicates that most people in Taiwan identify as Taiwanese - embracing a distinctly different identity.

m_text : Some of this is because of theBut his music is also continuing to make waves.In June, Moose Wala's last song SYL was removed from YouTube in India after the government lodged a legal complaint. The posthumously released song talks about decades-long dispute over sharing river water between Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana, while also touching upon some other controversial subjects like Sikh militancy. It's fitting that his legacy of asking hard questions continues even after his death.In a career spanning just four years, Moose Wala wrote several powerful lyrics that explored the history and current state of Punjab. Critics say the state has an unsavoury side, involving a gritty gangster culture, corruption and rising unemployment and his music spotlighted that.His fans see him as a man who was engaged with social realities. But what set him apart from his contemporaries was that he also offered a divergent vision of how Punjabis perceive themselves and his ideas were often considered unsettling and incendiary. His affinity for guns and attempt to force listeners into complex and sometimes even uncomfortable conversations - like SYL - made him the subject of intense scrutiny."There is no doubt that he was a man of contradictions," says Harinder Happy, a research scholar who has studied Punjab closely. "But his style spoke to the times and to living in a post-modernist society where everyone has the right to assert their identity the way they understand it." Moose Wala was also deeply rooted to his home and village in a state where thousands are looking to immigrate to foreign shores in search of a better life. "He was many things, but above all he was deeply connected with the ecology of his village," says Pritam Singh, professor of economics at Oxford Brookes University, who has followed Moose Wala's music closely.The singer was born as Shubhdeep Sidhu in a upper-caste Jatt-Sikh family. After studying engineering, he moved to Canada, where hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have emigrated.It was there that he began his music career, releasing his debut album PBX 1 in October 2018 under the stage name of Sidhu Moose Wala  - or "Sidhu of Moosa", his village.The singer maintained a distinct hip-hop vocabulary, from clothes to style, which made him an instant hit on the global stage. His music at the time was also typically macho - as rap music often is - and swaggered on the edge of violence. Unapologetically belligerent, he sang about his fondness for guns, boasted about his caste and gave details of a put-down of his enemies."Moose Wala could've lived anywhere he wanted. But he chose his village, his parents and his people," Mr Happy says. "He not just held on to his village identity but also sought to elevate it, despite its complexities."Mansa district, where Moose Wala's village is located, is widely seen as a backward region - it has one of the highest farmer suicide rates in Punjab and high unemployment levels and a serious groundwater crisis."People don't want to be identified with the region - they want to leave and never come back," Mr Happy explains. "But Moose Wala was different. He took pride in his roots and his music urged listeners to proudly accept the village as home."This is captured most powerfully in Tibeyan Da Putt (Son of the sand dunes), signifying the semi-arid landscape of the region. "We do not belong to noble families/ Brought-up in the village and townships/ I don't have any existence of my own/ Yet, influential people fear me," the lyrics say.Song after song, Moose Wala evoked the pull of village life, urging his listeners to embrace an agrarian lifestyle. In Bambiha Boley, he highlighted the beauty of traditional folk music; in Never Fold, he turned to stories of Robin Hood-like folk heroes who robbed the rich to help the poor.Mr Happy says that Moose Wala came to embody the aspirations of the entire region, helping people cope and take pride in their identity."And he was accessible - anyone could meet him and he loved his fans. The singer often shot most of his videos in his village, featuring his family, which made him even more relatable," he adds.Over time, Moose Wala's music also became more socially, culturally and politically conscious.The most iconic of these was 295 - a song about freedom of speech in India. The title refers to Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code, which penalises actions "intended to outrage religious feelings".In 2020, his song on India's contentious agricultural laws became an anthem for protesting farmers. The lyrics - "This is none other than the Punjab, which takes revenge with an open challenge" - were hailed for embodying the power of resistance, but critics said they were problematic and glorified violence. Moose Wala never really stopped being controversial - he continued to sneer at his enemies and pose with guns. "But over time, he moved away from casteist metaphors and his engagement with weapons became more measured," Prof Singh says.This thematic shift, he adds, is central to the singer's personality. "That's because Moose Wala's story is also one of personal evolution. And unless we understand that, we cannot understand why he was so popular."The contradictions don't end there.Both Prof Singh and Mr Harry point out that unlike other rappers, Moose Wala's music lacked the sexual explicitness often associated with hip-hop and especially rap and his music never objectified or denigrated women.In Dear Maa - a song dedicated to his mother - Moose Wala does not eschew overt sentimentality. Rather, he embraces it, Prof Singh says."It is remarkable that a man who is accused of being masochistic and violent is actually saying 'mother, I am like you'. And he captures the nuances so beautifully - one moment he says he's hot as the sun but other times he is soft like her."In his memoir, popular American rapper JayZ wrote: "Rap is built to handle contradictions." And Moose Wala's music almost always carried multiple meanings, from political leanings to the messiness of identity and questions that often defy simple explanations.Mr Happy says that music was Moose Wala's way to hold difficult conversations, to talk back and to assert his identity."His music's most persistent subject has been what it means to be Punjabi and how identity cannot be a monolith. Every album, every song, and every word is dedicated to demonstrating this truth," he adds.This inquiry into the Punjabi identity was also rooted in his insistence that life in Punjab was more than just violence and drugs. By blending folk music with slick beats and sounds, Moose Wala was able to create rhymes that addressed the lives of Punjabis in ways they understood."It was this rural rootedness of his which resonated with people so deeply," Prof Singh says.More than anything, Moose Wala, Mr Happy says, put forth an exciting idea that there was freedom to be found within music."And being controversial is inevitable when you ask tough questions."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

Speaking to BBC journalist Nick Raikes, he said: "I never thought it would be something that I would get".According to the UK Health Security Agency, there have been more than 1,000 cases of monkeypox identified in the UK since the start of May.The majority of people infected have been men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men, with most living in London. Ahead of London Pride the city's public health director, Prof Kevin Fenton, has advised those with monkeypox symptoms such as blisters, fevers, swollen glands, to stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.Monkeypox is spread through close contact, such as touching skin or sharing bedding with someone who has monkeypox or has monkeypox symptoms.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Russia strongly opposes the two states joining and has used the expansion of the West's defensive military alliance as a pretext for its war in Ukraine. Both countries have held neutral status for years, but since Russia's invasion of Ukraine support for Nato membership has risen dramatically. Vladimir Putin's actions have shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable.Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a "done deal" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February. For many Finns, events in Ukraine bring a haunting sense of familiarity. The Soviets invaded Finland in late 1939. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory.Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: "Could this happen to us?" Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years, with several reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft.In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago.Two years later Sweden's army In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union.This video can not be playedIn 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. The army, which serves a population of 5.5 million, has a wartime strength of Sweden took a different path in the 1990s, reducing the size of its military and changing priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that all changed in 2014, when Russia seized and annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Conscription returned and defence spending was boosted. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled "if crisis or war comes" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security, so Sweden and Finland joining the alliance will be perceived as a provocation.Russia's foreign ministry While not dismissing these threats, Alexander Stubb suggested a more realistic risk was of Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations.There is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe it will not.Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place.Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator.Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said.Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 "friendship agreement". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence.If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a "buffer zone", he said.Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Iro Sarkka suggested joining Nato was seen as too big a step for Finland to take in the early 1990s, having just emerged from neutrality.But times and perceptions of risk have changed. Now, most Finns say they are ready.For weeks, Sweden and Finland's applications were held up by Turkey. Any Nato enlargement must be approved by all 30 members.The Turkish government claimed the Nordic nations were supporting what it calls terrorist organisations, including Kurdish separatists and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations.In exchange for its support, Turkey said it wanted Sweden and Finland to stop providing political, financial and "arms support" to the groups. It also wanted them to resume selling weapons to Turkey and hand over individuals with alleged terror links.After hours of talks at the Madrid Nato summit in late June, foreign ministers from Sweden, Finland and Turkey signed a joint security pact addressing Turkey's concerns.Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Sweden had agreed to step up its work on Turkish extradition requests of suspected militants. The two Nordic nations also said they would lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey, he added.In exchange, Turkey will lift its veto on the Nordic nations joining the alliance.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Their town, Lismore, was caught in the catastrophic floods that submerged southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in February and March. Those floods have become the The latest flooding to hit Australia Back in February, perched on a hill the Sprogis family home was safe, but the couple were worried about their downtown physiotherapy business. It was purposely located on the second floor but even that was not enough.From the water-height charts they could tell the office was going to be inundated, but it was too late to save anything, the authorities had already issued an evacuation order."We could have put things up higher at that time, had we known, but we didn't," says Mr Sprogis, who had been at his practice the night before."I even left my new laptop on the office desk, thinking, well, [the water has] never been in here before so it won't come in." By the following day, his practice was 1.8m underwater, files, records and equipment all damaged or lost.Meanwhile in New South Wales in Gibberagee, children's book author Candy Lawrence watched as 2,000 copies of her books were sucked into the deluge.Ms Lawrence had been carefully watching government flood warnings and gathering supplies, anticipating that nearby roads would be cut off, as often happened when the area flooded.But, like Mr Sprogis, she was not expecting water to sweep through her property and that of her neighbours, some of whom had to scramble onto their roof to escape the fast-rising floodwaters."I feel like the world is pretty much ending, so why bother educating children?," she says, referencing her destroyed book collection and the terrifying new weather patterns.Like thousands of others caught in the disaster, Mr Sprogis and Ms Lawrence would have liked more warning. So why wasn't there a better system, which could alert them in real-time if their properties were in danger?Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer specialising in hydrology and flooding asked this question after watching her friend's house in Brisbane flood over the roof peak in 2011. The question came up again after she moved to Calgary, Canada, and witnessed a similarly devastating flood in 2013.Ms Murphy knew that during the Brisbane and Calgary floods, hydrology forecasts had predicted where rivers would peak at certain bridges, but she realised it wasn't enough. "If you aren't a hydraulic engineer [who is able] to translate that flood height into an impact to properties - your personal property, your car - it can be very challenging," she says. Ms Murphy also notes that static flood maps - including those that chart one-in-100-year floods - are also expensive, and can take days, or weeks, to produce. This makes them more suited to development planning and infrastructure design applications, rather than emergency planning and management."I was thinking, there has to be something more," says Ms Murphy. She began dedicating her evenings and weekends to looking for a solution, which eventually led her to co-found FloodMapp with web developer, Ryan Prosser.With a significant research and development investment, FloodMapp was launched in 2018.FloodMapp's technology can rapidly forecast water levels to map floods before they happen. It does this by ingesting huge amounts of historical data (including things like rainfall and ground saturation levels) and uses artificial intelligence to accurately model the way water will behave.The software also uses information about land features and river systems to work out how a flood will affect different areas. The company claims its models can run 100,000 times faster than traditional techniques.An added benefit is that the resulting models can refresh hourly using real-time river sensor data and rainfall forecasts.The technology is not available to individuals, instead it is being integrated into services offered by government agencies in Australia and the US, to better understand floods before, during and after they happen. Researchers at the University of Melbourne's Department of Infrastructure Engineering are taking a similar approach, understanding that speed is key for emergency planning.Like Ms Murphy, flood modeller turned researcher, Dr Wenyan Wu, is looking at ways to simulate flood levels over time, at speed, using machine learning techniques. Importantly, this is being done Dr Wu says without compromising accuracy and without costing the earth.The availability of accurate real-time data that can be interpreted at a property-specific level is a huge part of the challenge, but being able to disseminate meaningful data to the public is also key. As Dr Wu says, "If people's collective comprehension [of flood risk] doesn't improve, you will not actually improve the situation."Even the concept of a one-in-100-year flood is widely misunderstood. (It means a flood event has a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, as opposed to there only being one major flood every 100 years.)That's where companies like the Australian-based Early Warning Network (EWN) come in. EWN sends opt-in SMS (text messages), email, landline and app push alerts to residents and businesses in at-risk areas, typically via insurers, councils and other government agencies who have signed up to their services. Flood alerts are primarily based on data collected and distributed by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.However, as operations manager Michael Bath explains, EWN has a 24/7 team of human severe weather forecasters (all of whom have an understanding of threats from their experience as storm chasers). This team assess the warnings, eliminate duplication, and send geo-targeted alerts, using custom-made software.This ensures people receive clear and localised information."If you've ever had automated warnings from weather agencies before, [you'll know] they can be very repetitive," says Mr Bath. "If you automatically send that to residents, they just get really annoyed with it and tune out."  Mr Bath, Dr Wu and Ms Murphy all agree that ultimately governments need to adopt these systems and technologies, and make planning decisions about whether future development should be permitted on floodplains and whether buy-back schemes are warranted in high-risk areas.However, in many cases, moving entire communities or renovating properties at scale using flood-resistant materials is not practical in the immediate future, given these measures require significant funding and political will."We need something today, right now, because we are living on floodplains, and emergency warnings and alerts fill a critical role to improve safety, to save lives and prevent damage," says Ms Murphy. "We have to work together to build a safer future."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The social media giant has filed a petition with the high court in Karnataka state resisting "several" such orders, sources told the BBC.Twitter was reacting to a letter from the government in June warning of "serious consequences" of non-compliance of such orders.Twitter has more than 24 million users in India, by one estimate.Hours after the petition was filed, federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar tweeted that all foreign Internet platforms had to comply with Indian laws. Sources familiar with the matter said the government had warned Twitter in June, saying it was the company's "last opportunity" to comply with a number of blocking orders. They fall under India's information technology law which allows the government to block online content that "threatens the security of the state" and public order among other things. They said Twitter had chosen to go to court due to the "seriousness of the threats" as failure to comply with the law could lead to criminal proceedings.The social media giant believes that the orders are "procedurally and substantially deficient" of the requirements of the law and many of them "demonstrate excessive use of power and are disproportionate," sources said.In several cases, for example, there are demands for entire accounts to be blocked, the sources added. And several accounts could involve content posted by "official handles of political parties".This is the latest move in a continuing face-off between Twitter and India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.Over the past year, authorities have asked the social media giant to remove tweets and block accounts, citing objections based on public order. These include accounts and tweets related to last year's During the farmers' protests Twitter briefly blocked some 250 accounts in response to a legal notice by the government, citing objections based on public order. These included accounts of an investigative news magazine, and activists and groups associated with supporting the months-long protests on the outskirts of Delhi. But Twitter restored the accounts in six hours, citing "insufficient justification" for continuing the suspension.Last year in February, Twitter was told that it was "welcome to do business in India", but it had to follow the laws of the country "irrespective of Twitter's own rules and guidelines".In May, Twitter The police served notice to the site after it labelled a tweet by the BJP as "manipulated media".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Mr Johnson is to stand down as party leader but intends to stay on as PM until the autumn.Greg Clarke has been named new levelling up secretary, and James Cleverly as education secretary.But some Tory MPs are urging him to go now to avoid government paralysis.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson must not be allowed to "cling on" in No 10 once he has resigned and threatened to use a confidence motion in Parliament to oust him."If they don't get rid of him, then Labour will step up in the national interest and bring a vote of no confidence because we can't go on with this prime minister clinging on for months and months to come," Sir Keir said.Former minister Sir Bob Neill told MPs there was a "serious question mark" over how long a "caretaker" prime minister could stay in place."Might it not be in everybody's interest to speed up the transition as much as possible?" he added.Mr Johnson has also appointed Robert Buckland as Wales secretary, Shailesh Vara as Northern Ireland secretary, Kit Malthouse as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Andrew Stephenson as minister without portfolio.It follows a dramatic 48 hours which saw dozens of ministers - including former chancellor Rishi Sunak - resigning and plunging Mr Johnson's leadership into crisis.Mr Sunak's replacement as chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was among the ministers urging the PM to quit.Mr Johnson resisted the calls until Thursday morning, when it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his MPs and that the government could no longer function.Less than three years ago, Mr Johnson won an historic landslide victory in a general election - but he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws.The revolt this week was triggered by revelations about the prime minister's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher.Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey said it had long been clear Mr Johnson was "unfit to lead our country", adding the "public won't forgive the Conservatives for propping him up for so long".In a tweet, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was a "widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end".Is it sustainable for Boris Johnson to carry on as prime minister until the autumn?His supporters will argue that offers some semblance of continuity and stability at a time where there's not much of either. Critics, such as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, are already arguing it isn't sustainable, given the huge number of vacancies in government. Labour also think he should leave as prime minister now and there should be an interim prime minister until the autumn.That argument will rage today.And another will begin: who should be our next prime minister? Mr Johnson's resignation will make him one of the shortest-serving British prime ministers since World War Two, with his tenure currently falling short of that of his predecessor, Theresa May.Mr Johnson became prime minister on 24 July 2019, meaning he has been in post for two years and 349 days.In contrast Mrs May, who became prime minister on 13 July 2016, served for three years and 12 days until she was forced out by her MPs over a Brexit deadlock.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : "Helwan Real Batman Battle" was set up after two users argued in jest over whether they were the caped crusader. A third proposed that they dress up in superhero costumes and "fight a battle" in Cairo's Helwan district on the night of 13 August to "solve this issue"."Whoever is still alive is the real Batman," the event's description said.The post prompted a wave of memes, jokes and quotes, and attracting favourable reactions from Egyptian celebrities.However, a few days later TV channels loyal to President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi expressed concern about the event, suggesting that it could be used to promote violence against law enforcement agencies.Well-known TV presenter Lamis al-Hadidi linked the date chosen for the event to the ninth anniversary of the bloody crackdown that followed the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. More than 900 people were killed when security forces broke up sit-ins by tens of thousands of Morsi supporters in two squares in Cairo on 14 August 2013, Hadidi warned viewers against "taking such things lightly", despite acknowledging that it all started as a joke.  She also urged the organisers to seek a licence from the authorities for the event, noting it was a legal requirement. Unauthorised public gatherings of more than 10 people have been banned in Egypt since 2013.Social media platforms are still seen by many in Egypt as the last "safe haven" for critics of President Sisi's rule. However, that appears to be a mistaken belief, since there is an interior ministry department tasked with monitoring the platforms 24 hours a day.The arrest of the "Helwan Real Batman Battle" organisers comes four months before Egypt hosts a UN climate summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.Environmental activists fear that the government will ban peaceful protests and gatherings during the Cop27 conference.Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is overseeing Cop27, said in May that his country was "developing a facility adjacent to the conference centre that will provide them the full opportunity of participation, of activism, of demonstration, of voicing that opinion".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy.Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind. The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive.Finland gets most of its gas from Russia, so the war in Ukraine has drawn the issue of green power into sharp focus. It has the longest Russian border in the EU and Moscow has Concerns over sources of heat and light, especially with the long, cold Finnish winter on the horizon are preoccupying politicians and citizens alike. But in a corner of a small power plant in western Finland stands a new piece of technology that has the potential to ease some of these worries. The key element in this device? Around 100 tonnes of builder's sand, piled high inside a dull grey silo.These rough and ready grains may well represent a simple, cost-effective way of storing power for when it's needed most. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production.But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. The toughest question is about intermittency - how do you keep the lights on when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow?Adding more renewables to the electricity grid also means you need to boost other energy sources to balance the network, as too much or too little power can cause it to collapse. The most obvious answer to these problems is large scale batteries which can store and balance energy demands as the grid becomes greener. Right now, But in the town of Kankaanpää, a team of young Finnish engineers have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand that they believe can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way. "Whenever there's like this high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly," said Markku Ylönen, one of the two founders of The device has been installed in the Vatajankoski power plant which runs the district heating system for the area. Low-cost electricity warms the sand up to 500C by resistive heating (the same process that makes electric fires work). This generates hot air which is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger. Sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time. The developers say that their device could keep sand at 500C for several months. So when energy prices are higher, the battery discharges the hot air which warms water for the district heating system which is then pumped around homes, offices and even the local swimming pool.The idea for the sand battery was first developed at a former pulp mill in the city of Tampere, with the council donating the work space and providing funding to get it off the ground. "If we have some power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it's the coldest, it's going to be extremely expensive," said Elina Seppänen, an energy and climate specialist for the city."But if we have this sort of solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense, I think."One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference - and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat? The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid. But storing green energy as heat for the longer term is also a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that's used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels.Other research groups, such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory But the Finns are the first with a working, commercial system, that so far is performing well, according to the man who's invested in the system."It's really simple, but we liked the idea of trying something new, to be the first in the world to do something like this," said Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant. "It's a bit crazy, if you wish, but I think it's going to be a success."Follow Matt on Twitter How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he "had a very productive" discussion with Mr Putin.It comes after Sri Lanka's energy minister warned at the weekend that the country may soon run out of petrol.On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo to protest against the government."I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel," Mr Rajapaksa tweeted in reference to his conversation with the Russian leader.Mr Rajapaksa also said he had "humbly made a request" for flights between Moscow and Colombo to resume, after the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot suspended services last month."We unanimously agreed that strengthening bilateral relations in sectors such as tourism, trade and culture was paramount in reinforcing the friendship our two nations share," he added.The country has already purchased oil from Russia in recent months to help bolster fuel supplies during the crisis, and the government has signalled that it is willing to buy more from the energy-rich country.Attempts by Mr Rajapaksa to resolve Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, including securing financial support from India and China, have so far failed to end weeks of shortages of fuel, power, food and other essential items.On Sunday, Last week, authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve its dwindling fuel stocks.On Thursday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised its key interest rates by one percentage point to tackle the soaring cost of living in the country.The lending rate was raised to 15.5%, while the deposit rate was increased to 14.5%, the highest in 21 years.It comes as annual inflation hit a record high of 54.6% in June as the cost of food rose by more than 80%.Hundreds of protesters had a day earlier on Wednesday gathered near the parliament building in Colombo as they launched what they called the "final push" to remove Mr Rajapaksa's government.This week, The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter "demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice".Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate one's travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said.Sri Lanka desperately needs the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin for both fuel and tourists, which are both vital to rescuing the country's economy.The island nation has virtually run out of fuel, crippling businesses and public transport.It is struggling to get oil shipments from its usual suppliers in the Gulf or elsewhere due to a lack of foreign currency as well as banking and logistical difficulties.Western nations have imposed restrictions on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is clearly willing to take the risk of triggering displeasure in Western capitals.To add to Colombo's woes, Aeroflot suspended Moscow-Colombo passenger flight services last month after a Sri Lankan court briefly detained one of its planes following a commercial dispute over payment.Russians accounted for almost a fifth of total tourist arrivals in the months before the war started in Ukraine. Even if the flights resume, it may not be easy to attract Russian tourists as they could find it difficult to pay for things while they are on holiday.Several Russian banks have been disconnected from using the SWIFT international payment system and Visa and Master credit cards have suspended Russian operations in response to Moscow's war on Ukraine.Sri Lanka has seen its foreign exchange reserves shrink due to economic mismanagement and the impact of the pandemic.As a result it has struggled to pay for imports of essential goods, including fuel, food and medicine.In May, it defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history after a 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired.The country is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a £3bn bailout.Sri Lanka's government has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be However, unless further action is taken, If nothing is done, Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Scandals that would have sunk other politicians appeared to have no effect on him. He was always able to bounce back. His gaffes and blunders became part of his brand. In an age of boring, machine-like politicians, he was seen as a "character", his unruly mop of blond hair and bumbling persona instantly recognisable even to those with no interest in politics. His fun-loving, relentlessly upbeat image, allied to formidable campaigning skills, helped him reach parts of the electorate more conventional Conservatives could not.He won two terms as mayor of London, normally a Labour stronghold, and helped convince millions to back Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum.He became prime minister in July 2019 without an election - but four months later secured an historic landslide victory, winning seats in parts of the country that had never voted Conservative before. As 2020 dawned, his dominance of British politics appeared to be complete. But then came coronavirus.A global pandemic would have tested any leader and Johnson's government made its share of mistakes, with the UK at one point having the highest death rate in the developed world.But, in the end, it was not his handling of coronavirus that led to his downfall. It was, rather, questions about his character and fitness for high office.To some long-time observers of Johnson's career, this did not come as a surprise. In From his earliest days, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson had a tendency to believe rules were for other people. "Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility," his teacher Martin Hammond wrote of the 17-year-old Boris. "I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else."His unwavering self-belief, however, left an impression."Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating," Simon Veksner, a school friend, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums.He won a scholarship to Eton, arguably England's most prestigious private school, where he discovered a love of Classics and began developing the persona that would become so familiar in his later life.Oxford University followed, where he achieved his ambition of becoming president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823, and the time-honoured training ground for Conservative politicians. He also joined the infamous Bullingdon Club, known for the rowdy, drunken behaviour of its members, which included future prime minister David Cameron.He left Oxford and was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but lost his job after falsifying a quote - an incident he would later describe as his "biggest cock-up". It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given work by then-editor of the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings.As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson set about ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. It was, Disaster loomed again, however, when a recording surfaced of a telephone call between Johnson and his old Oxford friend, Darius Guppy, who had been demanding the private address of a News of the World journalist.The tape suggested Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though Guppy, who was later jailed for fraud, had indicated he had wanted to have the reporter, who had been investigating his affairs, beaten up.Hastings confronted him about the recording, which had been sent anonymously to the Telegraph, but after an apology, with Johnson deploying, in Hastings' words, "all of his self-parodying skills as a waffler", he was sent back to Brussels with a rebuke.In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament.With the Tories languishing in opposition, then-leader Michael Howard was keen to harness the star power of the new MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.But Mr Johnson's career as a frontbencher was short-lived.In 2004, Mr Howard ordered him to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city over a Spectator article that had attributed some of the blame for the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of the city's football fans. He survived "Operation Scouse Grovel", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.Within a year he was back on the frontbench, under new Tory leader David Cameron. But he was increasingly seen as comedian and TV personality, rather than a serious candidate for power.He had to wait until 2007 to get a chance to move up the ladder, when a somewhat trepidatious Cameron selected him as the Conservative candidate for London mayor. Johnson surprised everybody by storming to victory over Labour's Ken Livingstone, who had looked unbeatable, and winning again four years later. As mayor, Mr Johnson scrapped the unpopular "bendy buses", implemented a bike hire scheme (colloquially known to Londoners as "Boris bikes") and oversaw arrangements for the 2012 London Olympics - leading to one of the more infamous images of his political career, as he dangled from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags.In early 2016, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a "career psychopath".Johnson deployed all of his formidable campaigning skills, although he came in for heavy criticism for the claim - printed on the side of a battlebus - that the UK sent the EU £350m a week, which did not take into account the UK's rebate.When his side emerged victorious, it was inevitable that Mr Johnson would throw his hat into the ring to replace the outgoing David Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. It was a brutal political assassination, met with dismay by Johnson's supporters.Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.His opponents had a field day trawling the archives for past gaffes and indiscretions, which included a 2007 newspaper column describing then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as looking like a "sadistic nurse in a mental hospital". He had also been forced to say sorry to Papua New Guinea over a reference to "orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing" and, going further back, had apologised for using an racial slur when writing about the Queen's tours of Commonwealth countries.During his tenure at the Foreign Office, Johnson supported a tough line against Russia and expelled 23 diplomats following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal. He also attracted criticism when he mistakenly said Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the aid worker imprisoned in Iran, had been working as a journalist.In 2018, he quit the cabinet in protest at Theresa May's Brexit deal, arguing it would lead Britain into "the status of a colony". He returned to his former highly paid job as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, immediately running into controversy and accusations of Islamophobia after writing that Muslim women wearing burkas "look like letter boxes".He remained a stern critic of May from the backbenches and, when she was forced to resign, he once again ran to be leader of his party. This time he was successful, building a commanding lead, not only with Conservative party members - with whom he had always been popular - but, critically, with Tory MPs.His first few months in the role proved to be rocky as he struggled to govern with his party's at first tiny, then non-existent majority in the House of Commons.He recruited Dominic Cummings - regarded with suspicion and seen as a troublemaker by many Conservatives - as his closest Downing Street aide. At Cummings' behest, he fought a guerrilla war against those MPs seeking to block his Brexit strategy, including some high-profile members of his own party.In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to "Get Brexit Done", a slogan dreamed up by Cummings.The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.In a dramatic televised statement, he announced a national lockdown, a move unprecedented in peace time. The self-proclaimed libertarian and champion of the free market was now ordering the nation to stay in their homes, shutting down of huge of swathes of the UK economy and promising to spend billions on subsidising the wages of furloughed workers.In April 2020, Johnson tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted "it could have gone either way".Less than three weeks later, his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth to their first child, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson - Nicholas in a tribute to the doctors who had treated him in hospital.The twice-divorced prime minister married Ms Symonds at Westminster Cathedral at the end of May 2020. Their daughter Romy was born in December 2021. Ms Symonds was a well-connected figure behind the scenes in the Conservative Party and her influence came to be resented by Mr Cummings and his close-knit team of former Vote Leave officials, who were now at the heart of the Downing Street machine.As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world, helping the UK economy to re-open earlier than most. The mass unemployment predicted by many had also been avoided. But his political problems were beginning to mount up.Back in May 2020, he had stood by Dominic Cummings when he came under fire over a lockdown-busting trip to County Durham. But Mr Cummings was forced out of Downing Street at the end of that year after losing a power struggle with Carrie Symonds, and now appeared determined to remove him from office. In an explosive appearance before a select committee, Mr Cummings said Mr Johnson was "unfit for the job" of prime minister, and that thousands of people had died needlessly because he had delayed lockdowns and ignored scientific advice.Johnson was also under investigation over an expensive designer revamp of the Downing Street flat where he lived with his family, which was initially paid for by a Conservative donor. He was ultimately cleared by his ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, but the peer later rebuked his boss for having "insufficient" respect for his role, after new information came to light that had not been revealed to his inquiry. Lord Geidt would later quit the role in exasperation at the prime minister's attitude to ministerial standards.Mr Johnson's political opponents, who had been unable to lay a glove on him at the height of the pandemic, were now making hay with accusations of sleaze and cronyism, and a prime minister with an apparently cavalier disregard for long-established rules of behaviour. This impression was not helped by Johnson's attempt to rewrite the disciplinary code for MPs to help his ally Owen Paterson, who was facing suspension for breaking lobbying rules. Johnson later confessed this had been a "total mistake".But worse was to come in November 2021, when the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police over lockdown parties, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.He faced an investigation by a Commons committee into whether he had misled Parliament with his initial claims that there had been no parties in Downing Street. The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. Booing was heard when Johnson and his wife arrived for the Platinum Jubilee thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral.He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite 41% of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to "get on with the job" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.The rollercoaster career of a politician who had defied political gravity for nearly four decades has finally come crashing to earth.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Using dyes, the so-called "camo-cropping" trial has been started by the Norwich-based British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO).It has been introduced at Morley Farms, near Wymondham, Norfolk, in an attempt to protect sugar beet from aphids.Farmer David Jones said pests can "reduce yield by 50% in a bad year".Fields of sugar beet have been dyed different colours using food dye at the farm.Scientists hope to find out if the camo-crops deter aphids from landing on the sugar beet and, if they do, which colours prove most effective.Mr Jones, from the He said the farm has to cope with "lots of things all of the time, principally the weather, but also weeds, and particularly aphids come and attack the crops and transfer virus into the crop"."We're always looking for new ways to control the problems we've got, if it's without pesticide [then] that can be beneficial to what we do," he said.Dr Alistair Wright, from the BBRO, said had used "colour as a dye to reduce the contrast between the immature beet and the soil".He said: "We're trying any approaches to deter the aphids from the crop and we know they use all sorts of senses when they are migrating in the spring."One of them is colour and the contrast between the plant and soil, so using the dye we are hoping to effectively hide the crops in plain sight form the aphids."Dr Wright said there were "early positive signs" but added results would not be fully known until the harvest.He said the organisation was also trialling other methods such as increasing ladybirds and planting a grass from New Zealand which releases chemicals that kill aphids."There's no silver bullet, no one thing we can rely on," Dr Wright added.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The crimes included forced disappearances, murder, torture and kidnapping of children.Among those sentenced was Gen Santiago Riveros, 98, previously convicted for other human rights violations. He received a life sentence after being found guilty of more than 100 crimes.The sentences were handed down by the federal court in the capital Buenos Aires on Wednesday.It ruled that crimes were committed against some 350 victims. Among them were six auto plant workers at the Mercedes Benz factory who were abducted by right-wing death squads for having union sympathies. They were then tortured in the notorious Campo de Mayo detention centre run by Gen Riveros outside Buenos Aires. Although they officially remain missing, it is believed they were killed some time after the kidnapping.The investigating judges interviewed about 750 witnesses over the period of more than three years.After a military junta led by Gen Jorge Videla seized power in Argentina on 24 March 1976, it began a campaign to wipe out left-wing opponents.Some 30,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared during the "Dirty War", as the campaign came to be known.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : US researchers tracked 350,000 people over 10 years to see how well so-called weekend warriors fared. The findings, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, suggest the type and total amount of exercise count, rather than how many sessions.At least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise is recommended. Going for a brisk walk, a light effort cycle on a bike or playing doubles in tennis would count towards this.Or you could do 75 minutes of vigorous activity - something like running, swimming or playing a game of football - say health experts in guidance published by the NHS. Many of the participants in the US study clocked up this amount in a week. But some crammed it into one or two sessions rather than spacing it out. Those who reached their recommended level of activity, whether during the week or the weekend, had lower a death risk than those who did less than the recommend amount.Strength exercises include yoga, pilates and heavy gardening. Very vigorous activity that can help achieve recommended physical activity levels and can be done in shorter, sharper bursts, includes:British Heart Foundation senior cardiac nurse Joanne Whitmore said: "This large study suggests that, when it comes to exercise, it doesn't matter when you do it. "The most important thing is that physical activity is undertaken in the first place."Whether you cram your exercise in on the weekend or spread it across the week, aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week. "Exercise can improve your health, reducing your risk of heart and circulatory diseases like heart attack and stroke."Moderate-intensity activities make you breathe harder and make your heartbeat faster than usual but you should still be able to have a conversation whilst doing them."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Many parts of the city remain inundated in waist-deep water as incessant rains lash the city, causing flooding. India's weather department has issued an orange alert for the city and its neighbouring districts, predicting heavy to very heavy rains over the next five days.Teams of the National Disaster Response Force - a specialised force that responds to life-threatening disasters in the country - have been deployed in the city as a precautionary measure. Monsoon rains are common in Maharashtra state - where Mumbai is located - around this time of the year. They are also central to the lives of people, shaping the fortunes of millions of farmers who rely on the rains to grow their produce. But experts say climate change has made rains exceptionally fierce and less predictable in recent years, and unchecked urban development often leads to flooded streets and homes and causes traffic snarls. Thousands of people migrate to Mumbai every day in search of jobs which fuels rapid construction, that is very often unregulated. Many areas have ageing drainage systems and that causes flooding as well. The city's vast mangrove swamps, which act as a natural buffer during floods, have also been built over in the past few decades. On Tuesday, Maharashtra's newly-appointed chief minister, Eknath Shinde, visited the disaster management control room to supervise relief and rescue efforts, as residents were seen wading through fetid waters as sewers overflowed, filling roads with muck. In many areas, commuter trains - the lifeline of Mumbai's transport system - were disrupted, bringing the usually bustling city to a standstill. In Thane district, many residents from low-lying areas have shifted to storm shelters as water sloshed through their homes. And the Kundalika river, located on the outskirts of Mumbai, was flowing above the danger level, news agency PTI reported. © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

m_text : Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth instalment in the superhero series, based on the Marvel Comics character.In a plot twist, it sees Natalie Portman's Jane Foster returning with superior powers to her ex-boyfriend Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth.In a three-star review, Peter Bradshaw said it was another "cosmic spectacular in the tradition of Mike Hodges' Flash Gordon", filled with "nice gags" and "big cameos", although he "missed some of the major characters" from the previous films.The movie was directed by Oscar-winner Taika Waititi who also features on-screen alongside Hemsworth, Portman, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson and Jaimie Alexander.The plot finds Thor on a search for inner peace after the apocalyptic events of 2019's Avengers: Endgame. But his quest for karma is interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) who is seeking the extinction of the gods... Thor included.To battle this evil, he enlists the help of Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and his old earthling astrophysicist flame Jane - now in possession of Thor's famous hammer and a red cape of her own."The film is probably on its strongest ground with the most purely absurd touches, such as the squabbling rivalry between the hammer Mjölnir, and his new weapon, the axe Stormbreaker - which is always crowding into the frame suspiciously when Thor starts swoonily hanging out with Mjölnir, unable to accept that Mjölnir is with Dr Foster now," wrote Bradshaw."Thor himself has conquered his weight issues, and is now a fine figure of alpha-maledom who literally makes young goddesses faint in one scene after he is disrobed and his manhood (or rather godhood) is revealed to them."While still full of "silliness", the new film has its "more solemn" moments, Bradshaw continued, with reference to Dr Foster's cancer and references to her chemotherapy.But it is ultimately "effectively ruled by one cameo", the critic warned, from a big Hollywood name - who we won't name here, don't worry - as Zeus.The comedy or "self-satire" that has become Marvel's trademark of late, he concluded "is becoming a bit of a cul de sac - but that isn't to say it isn't still funny, and Thor still delivers a mighty hammer-blow, or rather axe-blow, of fun.""Of course, Ragnarok's distinctive humour is carried over, and there's a blissfully dumb running joke about a pair of giant, heavy metal-screaming goats," wrote Clarisse Loughrey. "But, really, it's the heart that matters here."Love and Thunder's characters are all running towards the same conclusion: That, no matter how long or short our time on Earth (or any planet) may be, we're all inevitably living for the benefit of others. "We love. Then we love again. It's nice for Marvel, always caught up in its own chaos, to remind us of something so simple".Loughrey noted how while the previous film had hinted at the bi-sexuality of Thompson's Valkyrie - now the King of New Asgard - the "deadpan nonchalance" she displays after losing the woman she loved in battle confirms it."I like plenty of Marvel movies just fine, but they are what they are, and what they are is products," he wrote."This one has enough wide-eyed boldness and shimmer to earn the designation of fairy tale."However Critic Grant Rollings said the creators had missed an opportunity by not calling it "Thor Four" - but he appreciated Waititi's attempt to re-create Ragnarok's "successful formula"."By putting comedy into the comic book, Waititi makes Love and Thunder a likeable rumble," he added, while dishing out three stars."Impressively, Waititi goes for a darker, more rousing tone in later reels, the one-liners and sight gags taking a backseat to a more sombre exploration of love and sacrifice," wrote Tim Grierson."Love And Thunder doesn't always gracefully execute its balance of light and dark but when the film focuses on the unshakeable bond between Thor and Jane, the results can be mighty moving."Finally, while Dr Foster may have gained equal footing with her godly ex, the new film is still Thor's playground, stressed "Disney's marketing talks a good game about how Jane is wielding the God of Thunder's hammer, Mjölnir, and has become a superhero called Mighty Thor," wrote Caryn James."True enough, but this is still original Thor's film. Fortunately, Hemsworth is better than ever at making the character the most human, lifelike and appealing of gods, a regular guy except when he's saving the world."She added: "This big-hearted Thor, thundering and sensitive, may be just the diverting hero we need right now."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : After more than four months of repeated Ukrainian bombardment, Russian forces have abandoned Snake orRussia says it has withdrawn its garrison as a "gesture of goodwill" to prove it was not obstructing grain exports, but Ukraine dismissed that claim, as Moscow continued to shell its grain stores.The island is exposed to attacks from all directions from air and sea, and the small garrison tasked with defending it - first Ukrainians and later Russians - has been described as "sitting ducks" by military experts. Seized by the Russians on 24 February, Snake Island is located just 35km (22 miles) off Ukraine's coast - well within the range of missile, artillery and drone strikes from the shore.And Ukraine's armed forces have done exactly that, claiming a series of devastating attacks on the island itself and any vessel bringing troop deployments and heavy weaponry.In April, Russia's anti-aircraft capabilities in the north-western Black Sea were significantly weakened with the sinking of the Moskva, That explains why the Kremlin was so desperate to bring in anti-aircraft systems and radio-electronic warfare to Snake Island. But it became a logistical nightmare for Russia to defend because it was so far from its main naval bases in the Black Sea.For all its attacks, Ukraine has very limited naval capacity, so has been unable to land its own force on the island. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov argues that stationing troops on Snake Island makes no sense for either side as they would become an easy target.  Instead, Mr Zhdanov advocates creating "fire control" - maintaining the capability to strike any target approaching the island.That would also give greater security to Ukraine's biggest Black Sea port of Odesa, and the whole north-western sector of the Black Sea.Russia already controls a large stretch of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, plus the Crimean Peninsula and the entire Sea of Azov. Holding Snake Island completed an effective blockade of Odesa, and meant exports of the vast majority of Ukrainian grain were impossible.It also meant the Black Sea coast became vulnerable to attack too, and military experts in Kyiv voiced fears that Russia could install long-range air defences, such as an S-400 air missile system.A look at the map also shows that Russian control of the island represented a threat to Nato member Romania - both its key port of Constanta and traffic in the mouth of the River Danube. It is not just strategically significant - this area is also rich in reserves of petroleum and gas.We've grown accustomed to this: Russia putting out a version of events that is wildly different from that presented by Ukraine or by Western governments.Moscow wants us to believe that there was no Russian retreat from Snake Island.The statement issued by the Russian Defence Ministry claims that Russian troops there had simply completed "assigned tasks" and left. It also called the departure "a goodwill gesture", to show that Russia wasn't hampering food exports from Ukraine. Considering the strategic importance of Snake Island, which has been fought over for months, and considering, too, the lack of "goodwill gestures" by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine since the invasion, this version of events will convince few outside Russia. Then again, this may be directed more at a domestic audience. The Kremlin wants the Russian public to believe that:This is not just a symbolic victory for Ukraine, it is a strategic success. For Russia this is both a setback and an embarrassing defeat.But it will not substantially change the course of the war. Russia's focus is on conquering the whole of the eastern Donbas and holding on to other areas of the south that it seized at the start of the war. Snake Island may be in a highly strategic part of the Black Sea and in an ideal spot for installing sophisticated missile systems, but ultimately it is still a very small rock.The key question is whether, by forcing the Russians out, the Ukrainians could consider resuming grain exports to reboot their war-ravaged economy. Without an effective navy, there is little chance of that yet, and Russian warships maintain their dominance over the Black Sea. "Practically, you need 10 things to happen before you can safely export grain and this is only one," says Andrew Wilson, professor of Ukrainian studies at University College London. Ukraine has rejected Russian offers to escort grain convoys from Odesa as they would require removing mines from outside the port. Turkey is actively involved in trying to negotiate an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine but the prospect of that happening appear remote at this stage.The next few weeks are seen as pivotal to Ukraine's exports - because the next harvest begins in July.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : About as much as eight months' worth of rain has come down in just four days, bringing parts of Australia's largest city to a standstill. Experts say no single factor can explain this extreme weather, pointing instead to warmer oceans and saturated soils as contributing factors.But conspiracy theorists aren't buying it. On social media, they blame the extreme rainfall on "cloud seeding" and "weather manipulation".There is no evidence to back up such theories, but this hasn't prevented falsehoods from reaching thousands of people online.Cloud seeding is a real thing. It involves manipulating existing clouds to try and help them produce more rain or snow. This is done by firing small particles (usually silver iodide) into clouds. Water vapour gathers around the particles and eventually falls as precipitation.The technique has been around for decades. It's not infallible, but it's been used all around the world to - for example - help irrigate crops.But there is no evidence to suggest cloud seeding has anything to do with the current rainfall in Sydney. That hasn't stopped some TikTok users from denouncing "weather engineering".They say it's all part of a government plan to "weaponise" the weather against its own people - a "The idea that this is happening on a widespread scale, and that there is some motive to manipulate the weather is a complete myth," says Dr Ellie Gilbert, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.And yet, this myth seems to have found an audience on various social media platforms. Many of the accounts seen by the BBC posting this type of content have also shared other conspiracy theories involving global warming, Covid vaccines, and the Moon landings.Some conspiracy theorists have been sharing a 2016 news report from the Australian TV network 7News - which has now been watched thousands of times.In it, the newsreader reports on concerns by Tasmanian residents that But a probe by the Tasmanian government found that cloud seeding did not contribute to or worsen the heavy rains - a conclusion since backed by independent scientists and experts."We don't have a co-ordinated effort to change the weather, because it's just physically and financially unfeasible," says Dr Gilbert, who adds that even if cloud seeding played a role, it would have "an absolutely miniscule effect."There is A In Australia, a La Niña increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones, and cooler daytime temperatures.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Lexi Robins, of Hemel Hempstead has the very rare condition Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP).Her mother Alex Robins said despite government promises no research funding into the condition had materialised.Health minister Maria Caulfield said £22bn had been committed to rare diseases by 2027.Mrs Robins said when Lexi was born in January 2021, she had a routine pregnancy and everything was fine. When she and husband David took Lexi back to their Hertfordshire home Mrs Robins noticed her baby's "big toe was bent inwards". "I wheeled her back into the maternity ward for someone to check her," Mrs Robins said. "They took some photos and we were told it was bunions, which I didn't believe."Source: After months of tests it emerged Lexi was missing the "knuckle and top bone in each of her big toes and she also had fused thumbs", Mrs Robins said.She said she ended up carrying out her own research and became increasingly convinced Lexi had FOP.By June 2021, genetic testing had confirmed Lexi did indeed have FOP. Mrs Robins struggled to accept the result."I just kept fighting and fighting, I just didn't accept it."Mrs Robins learned there was, she said, "limited research worldwide" into the condition and just one UK facility - in Oxford - that studied the condition."I was informed the charity FOP Friends needs to raise nearly £200,000 a year to keep this lab going to find a cure for [the illness]."Not only has your kid got FOP," she said, "but you have to raise money to try and find a cure for it - there's nothing on the NHS."To raise awareness of the condition, the family raised £170,000 in less than a year and set up a petition aimed at getting the funding of rare diseases discussed in parliament. A debate took place in December though as yet, no specific funding has been pledged to research FOP.For Lexi's parents, the most important consideration is keeping her safe and well."One of the most common things is that some of the more severe flare ups are caused by an injury or a fall," Mrs Robins said.The family has sold its home and is working to build a bespoke bungalow, with soft furnishings and no hard corners.The aim of the new home, they said, was to "keep her as safe as possible, under our care, to help prolong the quality and extent of her life"."We have to fight for the hope for a possible cure," Mrs Robins said. "It's overwhelming but you do anything for your children."Addressing the government, Mrs Robins asked: "When are you going to step up?"We've raised the money, we got the signatures, nothing has come of it."We don't fall into the rare diseases [category] - we want resources dedicated to finding a cure with a research team and a dedicated nurse for FOP patients."We need action now. The more years funding is prolonged, the worse people like Lexi get. "Mrs Robins said she has the support of Sir Mike Penning, the Hemel Hempstead MP.Sir Mike said the campaign for FOP research funding was "all about momentum"."We need to keep the pressure on," he said. "I will continue to push ministers to push the scientists that will make the decision on funding."Health minister Maria Caulfield, said: "I know rare diseases like FOP pose immense challenges for the people living with these conditions and I want to thank campaigners like Lexi and her family for bringing attention to such an important area."It's crucial we continue to improve our understanding of rare diseases, which is why we've committed to increase overall spending on research to £22bn by 2027. She added that research funding was available through the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).The government has also committed £40m of new funding to the NIHR BioResource, a network of academic and clinical experts, to further its work in characterising and understanding rare diseases.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : An estimated 2.3 million people or one in 30 has the virus - a rise of 32% on the week before.The rise is being driven by two new fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron - called BA.4 and BA.5. People can be infected even if they've had Covid before, but jabs are helping to protect against serious illness.Health officials are urging anyone over 75 who has not had a vaccine or booster in the past six months, to get one.In the week ending 24 June, the ONS estimates Covid rates were:Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: "Across the UK we've seen a continued increase of over half a million infections, likely caused by the growth of BA.4 and BA.5 variants."In its analysis of England, it found infections were going up in all regions and in all age groups.In Scotland, which has had the highest Covid rates in the UK since the end of May, the rise in infections may be slowing slightly. In England, almost 9,000 hospital beds were taken up with Covid patients on 30 June - and that number has doubled since the start of the month.Data from the other UK nations is not as up-to-date but suggests a similar rise over the last month.The number of Covid patients in hospital is currently still way below the record high of more than 34,000 in January 2021, during the wave of the Alpha variant of coronavirus.Not all hospital patients testing positive for Covid are being treated for it - some are there for another reason, but it can make their care more difficult.This applies to about two-thirds of patients in hospital at the moment.The number of Covid patients in intensive care has reached 211 in England, which is an increase from 111 at the start of June.Back in January 2021, more than 3,700 people needed this type of care at a time where intensive care units were in danger of being overwhelmed.Health officials are advising anyone aged over 75 who hasn't had a vaccine in the past six months, to get a booster jab to help protect against becoming seriously ill with Covid and ending up in hospital.About 16% of that age group haven't yet taken up the offer, says Dr Mary Ramsay, director of clinical programmes, from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).She also urged people to think about reducing spread when mixing with others."It is sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. "If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others - especially elderly or vulnerable people," Dr Ramsay said.Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Covid at UKHSA, told the BBC: "I think it's far from a bad cold."People are experiencing illness for seven to 10 days, she said, and while they had symptoms "they should avoid other people"."Avoid going to those festivals, avoid going to events and avoid indoor places, because that increases the risk of transmission in all of those places," she added.Virologist Dr Julian Tang, from the University of Leicester, said the sub-variants now spreading were likely to cause more problems."We may see more cases with more hospitalisations during the summer - especially in the unvaccinated, and in those whose vaccine and natural immunity is waning."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedLithuania has donated a Turkish drone to Ukraine, to assist with its defence against the Russian invasion.A Lithuanian broadcaster, Laisves TV initially crowdfunded 6m euros (£5.1M) to buy the aircraft from Turkish manufacturer Baykar, who later decided to donate the drone for free. The Lithuanian government has said that the funds that were raised will go towards arming the drone and supporting humanitarian aid in Ukraine. The drone was unveiled at a military airfield near the north Lithuanian town of Siauliai. Large crowds came to watch, with some of the attendees being people who donated to the cause.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : "She's the most fantastic singer," said Rodrigo, introducing her special guest, "and she sings one of my favourite songs of all time".Imbruglia took the first verse and chorus, with Rodrigo joining her for the rest of the song. As the song ended, the young pop star bowed at Imbruglia's feet."That was incredible," she told fans at the 5,000-capacity Eventim Apollo.Torn was originally featured on Imbruglia's debut album, Left Of The Middle, released in 1997 - six years before Rodrigo was born.The duet came days after Rodrigo sang an impromptu cover of Torn in a Manchester bar, following a gig in the city.This isn't the first time the star has been joined onstage by an artist she admires.She linked up with Lily Allen at the Glastonbury festival last month to perform F You, which she directed at the US Supreme Court justices who had overturned the constitutional right to abortion a day earlier."So many women and girls are going to die because of this [decision] and I wanted to dedicate this next song to the five members of the Supreme Court who showed us at the end of the day they truly don't give a [expletive] about freedom," said the 19-year-old."We hate you! We hate you!" On the North American leg of her Sour tour, Rodrigo was also joined by Alanis Morissette to cover You Oughta Know in Los Angeles, and by Avril Lavigne for a cover of Complicated in Toronto.Complicated remained part of her set list on Thursday night, alongside all 11 tracks of her 2020 debut album, also titled Sour.The record, which documents a turbulent break-up, catapulted the Disney actress to global success, earning multiple Grammy Award wins on top of 385 million streams in its first week on Spotify.She had never performed in concert when the album was released last May; and her early festival shows sometimes betrayed her lack of experience. But the star has come on leaps and bounds, with an effortless stage presence and an easy chemistry with her all-female band - who lean into the pop-punk riffs of hits like Brutal and Good 4 U; and burnish her more delicate songs into arena-sized power ballads, At times, however, they're barely audible above the chorus of (mostly-teenage) fans belting out the words. This is particularly true on Rodrigo's break-out hit Drivers License. By the end of the song, she abandons the microphone, allowing the audience to complete the final chorus while she accompanies them with hushed chords on her mirror-ball baby grand piano."I wrote that song literally crying in my living room," she tells the audience. "I never in a million years thought a sold-out crowd in London would be singing it back to me, so thank you."Rodrigo will wrap up her world tour with a second show at London's Eventim Apollo on Thursday, 7 July. Her Disney Plus show High School Musical; The Musical: The Series is due to return on 23 July, while the star is currently working on a follow-up to Sour."I have a title for my next album and a few songs," "It's definitely a different experience writing a second album after having a debut that was so well received [but] I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself… just sort of explore and have fun right now."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy.Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind. The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive.Finland gets most of its gas from Russia, so the war in Ukraine has drawn the issue of green power into sharp focus. It has the longest Russian border in the EU and Moscow has Concerns over sources of heat and light, especially with the long, cold Finnish winter on the horizon are preoccupying politicians and citizens alike. But in a corner of a small power plant in western Finland stands a new piece of technology that has the potential to ease some of these worries. The key element in this device? Around 100 tonnes of builder's sand, piled high inside a dull grey silo.These rough and ready grains may well represent a simple, cost-effective way of storing power for when it's needed most. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production.But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. The toughest question is about intermittency - how do you keep the lights on when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow?Adding more renewables to the electricity grid also means you need to boost other energy sources to balance the network, as too much or too little power can cause it to collapse. The most obvious answer to these problems is large scale batteries which can store and balance energy demands as the grid becomes greener. Right now, But in the town of Kankaanpää, a team of young Finnish engineers have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand that they believe can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way. "Whenever there's like this high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly," said Markku Ylönen, one of the two founders of The device has been installed in the Vatajankoski power plant which runs the district heating system for the area. Low-cost electricity warms the sand up to 500C by resistive heating (the same process that makes electric fires work). This generates hot air which is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger. Sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time. The developers say that their device could keep sand at 500C for several months. So when energy prices are higher, the battery discharges the hot air which warms water for the district heating system which is then pumped around homes, offices and even the local swimming pool.The idea for the sand battery was first developed at a former pulp mill in the city of Tampere, with the council donating the work space and providing funding to get it off the ground. "If we have some power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it's the coldest, it's going to be extremely expensive," said Elina Seppänen, an energy and climate specialist for the city."But if we have this sort of solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense, I think."One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference - and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat? The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid. But storing green energy as heat for the longer term is also a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that's used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels.Other research groups, such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory But the Finns are the first with a working, commercial system, that so far is performing well, according to the man who's invested in the system."It's really simple, but we liked the idea of trying something new, to be the first in the world to do something like this," said Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant. "It's a bit crazy, if you wish, but I think it's going to be a success."Follow Matt on Twitter How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Energy and fuel costs are rising rapidly around the world, pushing up prices in general more quickly.However, UK banks are in a position to weather even a severe economic downturn, the Bank said.It told banks to keep more money in rainy day funds to ensure they can weather any storm.The Bank's comments came in its latest Financial Stability Report.International forecasters such as the IMF and OECD have said Britain is more susceptible to recession and persistently high inflation than other Western countries, all of which are grappling with energy and commodity market shocks.While the Bank said the UK's banking sector was well-placed to cope with a severe downturn, it said banks must increase the amount of money they set aside to absorb shocks. Starting a year from now, banks will be required to set aside a sum equal to 2% of their assets as a buffer, as opposed to the normal 1%.The Financial Policy Committee said it could vary the rate in either direction depending on how the global economy pans out.Households have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as energy, food and fuel prices soar.In April, domestic energy bills jumped after the price cap was increased by 54% to £1,971 for the average household.Experts believe this could rise again in October, to around £2,800, which could help to push inflation up to more than 11% later this year."Commodity price volatility following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further exacerbated price pressures facing households and businesses, and has had implications for the financial system," the Bank said.Some households could struggle with debt. About 80% of mortgages are currently on fixed interest rates, but some 40% of these are set for renewal this year or next, which could push up costs for these households."Tighter financial conditions and reduced real incomes will weigh on debt affordability for households, businesses and governments in many countries, increasing the risks from global debt vulnerabilities," the Bank said.However, despite increasing pressure on household budgets, the Bank said financial institutions were resilient to debt vulnerabilities among households and businesses.The pound also lowered 1.6% against the dollar and hit a two-year low on Tuesday. Another surge in gas prices in Europe and the UK which could push inflation higher again, has added to fears the economy could slide into a recession. It says something about the lengths that have been gone to over the past 15 years to shore up the resilience of the banking system that it looks, according to this report, comfortably able to withstand not only the biggest economic contraction in 300 years over the pandemic, but also stagflation and the highest inflation in four decades.It's more households and small firms, rather than the financial sector, that are vulnerable at the moment. The Financial Policy Committee said that households' debts haven't shot up - yet - in response to the cost of living crisis, and it also takes the view that the proportion of households who spend a large portion of their incomes on servicing debts will remain manageable, in spite of rising interest rates, because of the package of help from the government. Its members are similarly sanguine about the effect on small businesses, acknowledging they could be hit by falling demand from households with declining real incomes, but forecasting that it would "take large increases in borrowing costs" to impair their ability to service their debts.Let's hope the committee's optimism isn't misplaced.Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank's verdict seems to be that "the situation isn't as quite as bad as previous crises"."Consumers might be coping with the biggest hikes in prices in four decades but compared to the months before the 2008 financial crisis hit, households aren't as likely to dig themselves deeper into more debt," she said."The escalating cost-of-living crisis is so stark that the government has already moved to pledge more support to those on lower incomes facing sky-high energy bills."She added that the Bank "expects businesses on the whole to struggle on".While many firms were struggling with supply chain challenges and weakening consumer demand, "overall it's going to take a much larger shock to see a domino collapse of companies unable to pay their debts", Ms Streeter added.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that "put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as "isolated holdouts" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: "Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator."Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are "positive consequences of global warming" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a "smooth" (longer) transition to greener energy."Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible," Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. "I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet." Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, "India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a "bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept "sledging" or "slurs". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically."Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic," wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. "And it was never more on show than this week as he sold "the Australian Way" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France."Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A "terribly messy week" for the prime minister.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care."People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute," says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. "What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life," Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP."If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat," she says. "We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this."Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, "there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed "persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment," pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as "enough evidence".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by "demonising" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.© 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

m_text : "At ten past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building."I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. "Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."Russia accuses In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion."This is the first time something like this has happened in the city," Lidiya tells me. "There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater.Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine; some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling."We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to," Lidiya tells me. "So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here." Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory. "Russia needs to give a proper response to this, so that there is no more shelling and so they stop scaring our people," says Vadim. We're talking near the police cordon. "Firing a missile back at Kyiv would have made them think." Knarik tells me she "feels sorry" for people in Ukraine. "They're the same as us. They have children, too. But I think we need to take harsher measures."  So many people here do not join the dots; they don't make the connection between Russia invading Ukraine and their lives becoming less safe. That's partly because the Russian state media does all it can to prevent those dots from being joined together in people's minds. It does so by demonising Ukrainians: referring to them as "Nazis", "neo-Nazis", "fascists" and "ultra-nationalists", and by repeating from morning till night that in this conflict Russia has justice on its side.But, also, many Russians simply don't want to believe that their country started this, that Russia could possibly be the aggressor.Now, though, a senior figure in the Russian Orthodox Church has spoken out for peace. Following the explosion in Belgorod, Metropolitan Ioann of Belgorod and Stary Oskol said it was time "to turn swords into ploughshares".On the website of the Belgorod Diocese, he wrote: "We humbly pray that the deceased find peace and that the injured heal. We pray for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which has today come to our homes too."Lidiya agrees."We need to restore good relations in a peaceful way," she tells me. "We need to come to our senses."This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The groups say it's the first lawsuit to challenge so-called airline industry "greenwashing". They argue that KLM adverts and their carbon-offsetting scheme create the false impression that its flights won't make climate change worse. But KLM says the company's statements are "based on solid arguments", and that it believes its adverts "comply with the applicable legislation and regulations".Netherlands-based group Fossielvrij NL - supported by ClientEarth and Reclame.NL - is taking aim at the company's Fly Responsibly campaign, which was launched in 2019.The campaign declared the airline is "creating a more sustainable future" and is on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It features a carbon offset product called CO2Zero, which KLM says funds reforestation projects or the company's purchase of biofuels. Carbon offsets balance out greenhouse gas emissions from polluting activities. But the groups argue the claims are highly misleading. They say the airline's plan to return to pre-pandemic levels of flights The environmental groups call the advertising campaign "greenwashing" - in other words, a misleading attempt to make the company seem environmentally friendly.They claim products like CO2Zero do nothing to limit damage to the environment, and that by promoting it to customers, the Dutch airline is undermining action to minimise climate change. They're bringing the lawsuit under the EU's Unfair Consumer Practices Directive. KLM says it had discussions with the environmental groups to see if there was any room for a solution other than a court case, but that it "proved impossible"."We critically assess all our communications about sustainability, and welcome input from all our stakeholders," KLM spokesperson Marjan Rozemeijer told the BBC. "We hope that a court ruling in this case will clarify how best to shape our communications policy."If the case in Amsterdam is successful, KLM will have to withdraw the advertising, stop any similar advertising in the future and issue corrections.Hiske Arts, a Fossielvrij campaigner, said: "Flight emissions cannot be 'compensated' if customers just pay extra to plant trees or give money towards the cost of false solutions like what the industry calls 'sustainable aviation fuels'. With these messages, KLM continues to throw sand in our eyes."We're going to court to demand KLM tells the truth about its fossil-fuel dependent product. Unchecked flying is one of the fastest ways to heat up the planet. Customers need to be informed and protected from claims that suggest it is not."But KLM says its Fly Responsibly initiative focuses on "flying being a conscious choice", urging people to "think twice before boarding an aircraft". Some argue that in sectors like air travel, where there aren't any realistic "green" alternatives, carbon offsetting can play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change. But climate scientists point out that for offsetting to work, the planted trees must be maintained over their lifespan - and this is difficult to guarantee. Joana Setzer, assistant professor of climate law at the London School of Economics, says companies are in a difficult position."They're forced to show they're doing something and announce commitments, but it's not only insufficient but dangerous for them to do so, as they might find themselves sued for misleading information," Prof Setzer says."With greenwashing, it's a relatively easy and cheap case to bring, but it's also a case where you can address the advertising as well as the communications around net-zero commitments."KLM says it's committed to communicating "transparently and honestly" about the company's approach to sustainability, and that it would not be in its interest "to misinform customers". Advertising regulators have recently cracked down on misleading marketing. In April, In September 2019, This case could have broader ramifications according to Prof Setzer, who says: "One case brought and won in a country has a cascade effect. Airlines exist everywhere, consumer protection laws exist everywhere. These are easily transferable."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Diplomats are normally protected from both criminal charges and civil cases in the countries where they are posted.But the court found a Saudi diplomat accused of exploiting a Filipina domestic worker in London did not have immunity in relation to the allegation. The decision paves the way for the woman to seek compensation. Lawyers said it was the first ruling of its kind in the world.The case was brought by Josephine Wong, 30, who alleges she was forced to work for Khalid Basfar and his family in conditions of modern slavery.Her lawyers say she was confined to the house at all times except to take out the rubbish, subjected to verbal abuse, and given only left-over food to eat when her employers were at home.She alleges that she was made to work from 07:00 until around 23:30 every day of the week, with no days off or rest breaks, and that she was forced to wear a door-bell so her employers could summon her at any moment.She alleges that after being brought to the UK from Saudi Arabia in 2016, she was not paid anything for seven months. She says she was then paid about £1,800 for six months' work in one lump sum - a fraction of her contractual entitlement - and after that not paid again. Ms Wong managed to escape in 2018 and brought a claim against Mr Basfar in an employment tribunal.  He argued that Ms Wong's claim should be struck out on the basis of his diplomatic protection.Under article 31 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomats enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution. But any commercial activity outside their professional work can be the subject of civil claims.The UK Supreme Court's justices have now ruled - by a majority of three to two - that if the facts of the case are proved, Mr Basfar does not have diplomatic immunity because his alleged exploitation of her amounted to commercial activity."Further, on the assumed facts Mr Basfar gained a substantial financial benefit by deliberately and systematically exploiting Ms Wong's labour for almost two years, initially for a fraction of her contractual entitlement to wages and latterly for no pay at all. This conduct is accurately described as a commercial activity practised for personal profit."The court also noted: "There is evidence that exploitation of migrant domestic workers by foreign diplomats is a significant problem, so that the question raised on this appeal is one of general importance."Anti-slavery campaigners have welcomed the ruling.Ms Wong's lawyer, Nusrat Uddin, told the BBC: "It's justice at last for our client. And for all of the potential victims at risk of being exploited by diplomats. It allows recourse to take legal action and that's extremely empowering."We hope that this will act as a deterrent and that other countries - for example the United States - will take the UK's lead on this."James Fookes, Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group Co-ordinator at the charity Anti-Slavery International, said in a statement: "We don't know the full extent of abuse and exploitation of domestic workers in the UK, but this ruling is the first of its kind in the world and will shine more light on this serious issue and will hopefully lead the way to greater protection."Mr Basfar's solicitors declined to comment on the ruling. There was also no immediate response from the Saudi embassy in London.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth instalment in the superhero series, based on the Marvel Comics character.In a plot twist, it sees Natalie Portman's Jane Foster returning with superior powers to her ex-boyfriend Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth.In a three-star review, Peter Bradshaw said it was another "cosmic spectacular in the tradition of Mike Hodges' Flash Gordon", filled with "nice gags" and "big cameos", although he "missed some of the major characters" from the previous films.The movie was directed by Oscar-winner Taika Waititi who also features on-screen alongside Hemsworth, Portman, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson and Jaimie Alexander.The plot finds Thor on a search for inner peace after the apocalyptic events of 2019's Avengers: Endgame. But his quest for karma is interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) who is seeking the extinction of the gods... Thor included.To battle this evil, he enlists the help of Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and his old earthling astrophysicist flame Jane - now in possession of Thor's famous hammer and a red cape of her own."The film is probably on its strongest ground with the most purely absurd touches, such as the squabbling rivalry between the hammer Mjölnir, and his new weapon, the axe Stormbreaker - which is always crowding into the frame suspiciously when Thor starts swoonily hanging out with Mjölnir, unable to accept that Mjölnir is with Dr Foster now," wrote Bradshaw."Thor himself has conquered his weight issues, and is now a fine figure of alpha-maledom who literally makes young goddesses faint in one scene after he is disrobed and his manhood (or rather godhood) is revealed to them."While still full of "silliness", the new film has its "more solemn" moments, Bradshaw continued, with reference to Dr Foster's cancer and references to her chemotherapy.But it is ultimately "effectively ruled by one cameo", the critic warned, from a big Hollywood name - who we won't name here, don't worry - as Zeus.The comedy or "self-satire" that has become Marvel's trademark of late, he concluded "is becoming a bit of a cul de sac - but that isn't to say it isn't still funny, and Thor still delivers a mighty hammer-blow, or rather axe-blow, of fun.""Of course, Ragnarok's distinctive humour is carried over, and there's a blissfully dumb running joke about a pair of giant, heavy metal-screaming goats," wrote Clarisse Loughrey. "But, really, it's the heart that matters here."Love and Thunder's characters are all running towards the same conclusion: That, no matter how long or short our time on Earth (or any planet) may be, we're all inevitably living for the benefit of others. "We love. Then we love again. It's nice for Marvel, always caught up in its own chaos, to remind us of something so simple".Loughrey noted how while the previous film had hinted at the bi-sexuality of Thompson's Valkyrie - now the King of New Asgard - the "deadpan nonchalance" she displays after losing the woman she loved in battle confirms it."I like plenty of Marvel movies just fine, but they are what they are, and what they are is products," he wrote."This one has enough wide-eyed boldness and shimmer to earn the designation of fairy tale."However Critic Grant Rollings said the creators had missed an opportunity by not calling it "Thor Four" - but he appreciated Waititi's attempt to re-create Ragnarok's "successful formula"."By putting comedy into the comic book, Waititi makes Love and Thunder a likeable rumble," he added, while dishing out three stars."Impressively, Waititi goes for a darker, more rousing tone in later reels, the one-liners and sight gags taking a backseat to a more sombre exploration of love and sacrifice," wrote Tim Grierson."Love And Thunder doesn't always gracefully execute its balance of light and dark but when the film focuses on the unshakeable bond between Thor and Jane, the results can be mighty moving."Finally, while Dr Foster may have gained equal footing with her godly ex, the new film is still Thor's playground, stressed "Disney's marketing talks a good game about how Jane is wielding the God of Thunder's hammer, Mjölnir, and has become a superhero called Mighty Thor," wrote Caryn James."True enough, but this is still original Thor's film. Fortunately, Hemsworth is better than ever at making the character the most human, lifelike and appealing of gods, a regular guy except when he's saving the world."She added: "This big-hearted Thor, thundering and sensitive, may be just the diverting hero we need right now."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The BBC's Anshul Verma visited the flood-hit area of Silchar city recently where he saw thousands of people struggling to access food, medicines and drinking water as flooded streets made any travel almost impossible.People searched desperately for boats, rafts or any mode of transport that would help them reach shelters set up by the government. Many said they struggled to evacuate the elderly and take ailing family members to hospitals.The Indian army and the National Disaster Response Force have been carrying out relief operations in the state, evacuating residents from flooded areas and bringing them food and water.More than 148,000 people are in 299 relief camps spread out across the state, Assam's disaster management agency said. But the situation in the shelters is not much better as several families are crammed into small spaces, sometimes up to 30 people to a room. Many of these shelters are homes or schools that have been temporarily turned into relief camps to take in people affected by the floods. Here, too, access to clean water and sanitation remains a struggle. People who injured themselves as they fled their homes in the middle of the night said they had not been able to get medical attention in the camps. Many said they had left all their belongings behind and lost important identification documents to the floods.© 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

m_text : The aviation industry sets its own goals for cutting its environmental footprint.A representative for the UK aviation industry said it was committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.In 2018 air travel was responsible for Possible, the charity behind the research, investigated the issue to find out whether airlines can be relied upon to tackle their role in causing emissions that lead to climate change."Companies set grand-sounding targets with a lot of fanfare and announcement. They talk about them for a couple of years - then the targets sink without trace, never to be seen again," Leo Murray from Possible told BBC News.The research looked at environmental goals airlines have set themselves since 2000. Most of the targets focussed on using greener fuels to power airplanes or making fuel more efficient.EasyJet was the only company named in the research that was found to have met a target. It successfully reduced fuel burn per passenger kilometre by 3% by 2015, Possible says.But Possible claim it missed other goals, including a plan in 2007 "The ecoJet was a prototype concept which was used to urge the industry to produce planes that significantly reduce carbon emissions. Our ultimate ambition today has only strengthened to achieve zero carbon emission flying," a spokesperson for EasyJet told BBC News.Possible also points out that between 2010-12 Virgin Atlantic said that Representing airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Matt Gorman, chair of Sustainable Aviation Coalition, told BBC News: "Technology improvements mean growth in passengers no longer means growth in emissions and the industry continues to innovate to reduce emissions further and faster. Whilst decarbonising aviation is a huge challenge, the solutions are real and, more critically, being implemented."The charity also claims that A spokesperson for the Virgin Group told BBC News: "For more than 15 years, Virgin has invested in and supported climate solutions which focus on solving the climate crisis through a range of cleantech ventures.  Our investment supports Virgin's target to reach net zero emissions across its whole portfolio by 2050 at the latest".  Mr Murray says the industry is "intrinsically high-carbon", meaning there are no good alternatives when it comes to technological solutions. Efficiency has been improving but the volume of flights has grown faster, he says.The findings undermine the government's climate change plans that aim to radically reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Mr Murray. The government's upcoming "It's a very high-risk strategy, it's not plausible. The government is putting all its eggs in the basket of aviation meeting their own goals - but their track record is terrible," Mr Murray suggests.The government's message is that we can carry on flying and still reach net zero by 2050.  Don't worry, it says, innovation will save the day. This report calls that policy into question.  If the aviation industry cannot find ways to make planes more efficient or take the carbon out of fuel then the government will need an alternative strategy.The most obvious is to manage demand by making it more expensive to fly often - but that need not mean your annual holiday is under threat.That's because a small number of people do most of the flying. Campaigners want a frequent flier levy - The first flight in a year could incur little or no tax, with the levy ramping up with each additional flight. The government's Climate Change Committee advisory body has previously A Department for Transport spokesperson told BBC News: "This report wilfully ignores this government's historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach Jet Zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes £180 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and £685 million to develop zero-carbon and low emission aircraft technology". Mr Murray also says the government should be prioritising making sustainable transport like high-speed rail or ferries more affordable and accessible.One scheme his charity runs encourages employers to give workers extra holiday days to allow them to travel abroad by train or ferry, which has a lower carbon footprint but can take much longer than flying.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he "had a very productive" discussion with Mr Putin.It comes after Sri Lanka's energy minister warned at the weekend that the country may soon run out of petrol.On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo to protest against the government."I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel," Mr Rajapaksa tweeted in reference to his conversation with the Russian leader.Mr Rajapaksa also said he had "humbly made a request" for flights between Moscow and Colombo to resume, after the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot suspended services last month."We unanimously agreed that strengthening bilateral relations in sectors such as tourism, trade and culture was paramount in reinforcing the friendship our two nations share," he added.The country has already purchased oil from Russia in recent months to help bolster fuel supplies during the crisis, and the government has signalled that it is willing to buy more from the energy-rich country.Attempts by Mr Rajapaksa to resolve Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, including securing financial support from India and China, have so far failed to end weeks of shortages of fuel, power, food and other essential items.On Sunday, Last week, authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve its dwindling fuel stocks.On Thursday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised its key interest rates by one percentage point to tackle the soaring cost of living in the country.The lending rate was raised to 15.5%, while the deposit rate was increased to 14.5%, the highest in 21 years.It comes as annual inflation hit a record high of 54.6% in June as the cost of food rose by more than 80%.Hundreds of protesters had a day earlier on Wednesday gathered near the parliament building in Colombo as they launched what they called the "final push" to remove Mr Rajapaksa's government.This week, The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter "demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice".Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate one's travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said.Sri Lanka desperately needs the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin for both fuel and tourists, which are both vital to rescuing the country's economy.The island nation has virtually run out of fuel, crippling businesses and public transport.It is struggling to get oil shipments from its usual suppliers in the Gulf or elsewhere due to a lack of foreign currency as well as banking and logistical difficulties.Western nations have imposed restrictions on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is clearly willing to take the risk of triggering displeasure in Western capitals.To add to Colombo's woes, Aeroflot suspended Moscow-Colombo passenger flight services last month after a Sri Lankan court briefly detained one of its planes following a commercial dispute over payment.Russians accounted for almost a fifth of total tourist arrivals in the months before the war started in Ukraine. Even if the flights resume, it may not be easy to attract Russian tourists as they could find it difficult to pay for things while they are on holiday.Several Russian banks have been disconnected from using the SWIFT international payment system and Visa and Master credit cards have suspended Russian operations in response to Moscow's war on Ukraine.Sri Lanka has seen its foreign exchange reserves shrink due to economic mismanagement and the impact of the pandemic.As a result it has struggled to pay for imports of essential goods, including fuel, food and medicine.In May, it defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history after a 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired.The country is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a £3bn bailout.Sri Lanka's government has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Now, the prime minister has lost the support of his MPs and is set to resign. How did it come to this?On Wednesday 29 June, the MP Chris Pincher - at the time, the Conservative deputy chief whip - went to a private members' club in London. In his words, he "drank far too much" He was accused of groping two men, which led to a flurry of allegations, some dating back years. It set off a chain of events that ended with the prime minister's downfall.First, Downing Street said Mr Johnson was not aware of "specific allegations" about Mr Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip in February. Ministers later reiterated this line - even though it turned out to be inaccurate.On 4 July, the BBC reported Mr Johnson had been aware of a formal complaint. The next day, a former civil servant - Lord McDonald - said the prime minister had been told of the complaint in person.Mr Johnson then admitted he had been told in 2019, and apologised for appointing Mr Pincher as deputy chief whip.This video can not be playedIn April this year, the prime minister was He also apologised for going to a "bring your own booze" party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown.More widely, the Metropolitan Police issued 126 fines to 83 people for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall.And a report by Sue Gray - a senior civil servant - described a series of social events by political staff that "The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture," she wrote.Last December, Mr Johnson told the Commons that "all guidance was followed completely in No 10". He is now being investigated by a Commons committee over Inflation has risen sharply in 2022, Many of the reasons were outside of Boris Johnson's control. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, has led to rises in oil prices and the cost of food.And, while the government has taken some steps - for example, by cutting fuel duty by 5p per litre - it also went ahead The government said the tax rise would pay for health and social care, and changes that kicked in this week "In the middle of the worst cost of living crisis for decades," said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in April, "the government chooses to increase taxes on working people".In October 2021, a House of Commons committee recommended a 30-day suspension for then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson. The committee said he broke lobbying rules, to try to benefit companies who paid him.But the Conservatives - led by the prime minister - After an outcry, This video can not be playedBoris Johnson won his thumping majority on the back of a clear, easy-to-follow policy - Get Brexit Done.But since then, his critics said, there was a lack of focus and ideas in Downing Street.His ex-adviser turned chief critic, Dominic Cummings, repeatedly accused him of being an out-of-control shopping trolley, veering from position to position.Others questioned the prime minister's philosophy - or, indeed, if he had one. In June, Conservative MP and former minister Jeremy Hunt accused Mr Johnson of lacking Mr Hunt was speaking before a confidence vote, which Mr Johnson won - but the complaints were getting louder.

m_text : The Liverpudlian says viewers get very frustrated on his behalf and regularly turn to Twitter to vent their frustration."It's appalling that the BBC are still using photographs and visual jokes'," he says they tweet."But that's what the show is, and I want to do that show," he tells the It's a refreshing take on inclusivity and accessibility that people often tie themselves in knots over. Many of the panel shows he appears on, including Would I Lie To You, rely on visual cues such as pictures, items or missing word rounds. He says it's not a slight that they continue to play such games in his presence, it's just part of the format which he doesn't want changed just because he is visually impaired. "I do the News Quiz on Radio Four, but I don't want Have I Got News For You to be morphed into the News Quiz just because I'm on it. They're both great shows." The production effort behind these decisions relies on "far fewer" meetings than you might think and adjustments are made swiftly and without much fuss."They meet me halfway," he says of the production teams. "They change one of the rounds to an audio round or something similar."He also lets his team mates know: "If there's something you want to tell me, describe it. And if they want to leave it in the edit, they will. And if they don't, they won't."It's something that cropped up when he filmed the 2022 QI Christmas special, in February. During the recording there was a visual magic trick without description.Afterwards, QI team captain Alan Davies apologised that McCausland hadn't been accommodated. "It's cool mate," McCausland told him. "The world is visual, it's television and not everything has to be for me." McCausland is more "comfortable" with himself and his impairment these days, but he found it difficult when he lost his sight in his 20s, due to a genetic condition called retinitis pigmentosa. Even now, "I still have a hatred of a white stick," he says referring to learning how to use a cane. "You think that everybody's looking at you blundering your way along and you become very self-conscious. You want to be normal, you want to be a cool 20-odd year-old and you don't feel like that."When he started his comedy back in 2003, a hobby away from his "soul destroying" call centre job, he would gloss over being blind."I'd do a joke at the beginning and I literally wouldn't mention it again. I wanted them to forget that I was blind."He says at the time he was trying to "challenge preconceptions" about blind people and the low expectations people might foist on them. "That was my clumsy way of doing it by not talking about it," he says.But as he approaches 20 years on the comedy circuit he's beginning to appreciate the unique insight he can offer. He's currently on a summer break from his mammoth 100-date tour, Speaky Blinder, in which he talks about his blindness more than ever. And while challenging preconceptions remains his "driving force", his approach has changed."I'm a big believer in achieving in the mainstream and so to be doing this tour in big venues and people paying their money to come along and watch, it's really lovely to see."He really did "achieve in the mainstream" a few weeks ago when he and fellow comedian Lee Mack created a comedy sketch around the pitfalls of a visual world for the Bafta TV Awards. It went viral, clocking up 6m views on the The duo, who are good friends, had spent the previous Wednesday at Mack's house drinking "too many cups of coffee" thinking up a sketch. They started playing around with who would say what and when McCausland can't see an autocue and the farce of the situation made them both laugh.  "We thought: 'This is the one'. We wanted to do something a bit riskier."It seemed "hilarious" on the Wednesday but by the Sunday, when they were backstage at the awards, they were beginning to wonder if they'd made a terrible mistake and were about to offend the entire nation."We'd never tried it in front of people and we were doing it on live TV in front of everybody that could ever give us a job in the TV industry. It was a bit of a gamble." It opens with McCausland telling the celebrity-filled audience that it's the first time a blind person has presented at the Baftas, "so Lee is going to tell me my bits from the autocue," and so follows a skit of crossed-wires, repeating each other's line and culminates with McCausland saying: "So let's take a look, apparently, or a listen, I suppose.." at the nominations.Their gamble paid off and it turned out to be the standout moment of the night. The joke was also popular with the blind community who laughed because it was so close to the truth."If you strip the jokes out of it, then it is just the normal things that people would say," Chris says, alluding to the sometimes clumsy way sighted people might try to be helpful.But life as a comedian, which has included hosting the BBC's prestigious Live At The Apollo show three times and appearing at the Royal Variety Performance, could have turned out very differently. McCausland graduated with a degree in software engineering in 2000, but found it difficult to get a job in an industry which was yet to get to grips with accessibility. He started applying for "mad stuff", including MI5 and made it to the final 30 applicants - "I was in the top 1% of potential spies. It's astonishing." He says "discrimination" ultimately held him back from being a spook, but there was one occasion of discrimination which he was, ironically, pleased about and "wholeheartedly" believes in. During an assessment day he was asked to sift information to identify potential threats within a limited time. In most other professions it's a task he would request a reasonable adjustment for - such as having more time to complete it. "But you can't have Waterloo blowing up and then them going, 'well, this guy needed extra time' can you? There are certain things where you go, 'thank God someone's had the guts to stand up and go, 'this bloke can't do this…'. There were also concerns that he might not blend in if he was on a mission to meet an informant to trade information with them. "What's more undercover than a blind bloke meeting his mate in the pub for a pint?'," McCausland asked."Good point," the assessor replied and wrote something down. "I've always loved to think, to this day, that he just wrote down 'employ more blind people'."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : US researchers tracked 350,000 people over 10 years to see how well so-called weekend warriors fared. The findings, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, suggest the type and total amount of exercise count, rather than how many sessions.At least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise is recommended. Going for a brisk walk, a light effort cycle on a bike or playing doubles in tennis would count towards this.Or you could do 75 minutes of vigorous activity - something like running, swimming or playing a game of football - say health experts in guidance published by the NHS. Many of the participants in the US study clocked up this amount in a week. But some crammed it into one or two sessions rather than spacing it out. Those who reached their recommended level of activity, whether during the week or the weekend, had lower a death risk than those who did less than the recommend amount.Strength exercises include yoga, pilates and heavy gardening. Very vigorous activity that can help achieve recommended physical activity levels and can be done in shorter, sharper bursts, includes:British Heart Foundation senior cardiac nurse Joanne Whitmore said: "This large study suggests that, when it comes to exercise, it doesn't matter when you do it. "The most important thing is that physical activity is undertaken in the first place."Whether you cram your exercise in on the weekend or spread it across the week, aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week. "Exercise can improve your health, reducing your risk of heart and circulatory diseases like heart attack and stroke."Moderate-intensity activities make you breathe harder and make your heartbeat faster than usual but you should still be able to have a conversation whilst doing them."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The central bank's focus was getting prices down and making life more affordable again, its chief economist Huw Pill said in a speech on Wednesday.In May, UK inflation hit Mr Pill said he was open to voting for an interest rate rise above 0.25%.This is the same figure the Bank of England decided on for the last five interest rate increases in a row.Mr Pill said his statement showed he was willing to adopt a faster pace of tightening but also emphasised that it was dependent on what the economic data showed.He stressed that "much remains to be resolved before we vote on our August policy decision"."How I vote on that occasion will be determined by the data that we see and my interpretation of it," he said.Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor at the bank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would act "forcefully" to make sure higher inflation does not become "the new normal".Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 one year and £1.09 the next year, then that's an annual inflation rate of 9%.The UK's rate of inflation is being driven up as the prices of fuel, energy and food soar in part due to the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.In June, the Bank of England warned inflation could reach 11%One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow less and spend less. Higher interest rates also motivate people to save more.The Bank of England chief economist's warning of "difficult times for many people" is meant to reiterate the commitment the Bank has to get inflation down in the coming months.Huw Pill's speech seems to back up forecasts in the City that the Bank will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next month.While we have heard repeatedly that the Bank and the government seek to avoid the emergence of a self-fulfilling spiral of rising prices and wages, perhaps the most interesting part of the speech concerned companies.He suggested firms were re-establishing profit margins through higher pricing after supply chain disruptions. He also pointed to worker shortages from both the pandemic and Brexit. These domestic factors could multiply the energy price rises leading to high persistent inflation.The Bank's job was already difficult, but changes in the UK economy, and further falls in sterling, are now complicating it further. Faster rate rises are on the cards.Analysts at Capital Economics have predicted that the Bank will ultimately have to lift rates to 3% to quash inflation.But other economists think they won't have to go so high. Pantheon Macroeconomics reckon interest rates will peak at 1.75%.Some manufacturers' groups have also urged the Bank of England to show some restraint on raising interest rates due to the importance of "low-cost borrowing".Mr Pill told a central banking conference hosted by King's Business School he wanted to speak more "directly" and "bluntly" about tackling inflation."Returning inflation to its 2% target is at the heart of the MPC's actions over the past 10 months," he said.The MPC stands for monetary policy committee - a group of nine members within the central bank that try to guide the economy with measures such as raising or lowering interest rates.Mr Pill said households were facing "difficult times"."We recognise the hardship associated with elevated inflation rates," he said, noting that lower income families were being forced to spend more on energy and food due to higher prices."Recent price rises have imposed a significant squeeze on their real incomes," he said. In June, the central bank raised interest rates from 1% to 1.25%, the fifth consecutive rise.Suggesting that further rate hikes were on their way, Mr Pill said: "Acting to achieve the 2% inflation target is now more important than ever. In the MPC, we have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take."Deputy governor Sir Jon told Radio 4's Today programme: "It's our job to make sure that as this inflationary shock passes through the economy we don't find that leaves us with inflation being the new normal, the sort of embedded psychology."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Jess Daly spent three weeks around the city of Dnipro in June, where she was embedded with the Hospitallers Medical Battalion. She said: "I was based in various towns and villages. There was constant shelling regardless of where the shells were landing and who they were targeting. It was barbaric."She said an ambulance worker who she spent time with last month, Natalia, also known as "Austria", died while taking part in an evacuation."It's very, very dangerous for them. "They're volunteers, they do this out of passion for their people and their country and although they are at constant threat they put their lives on the line regardless."A field hospital she had visited in Avdiivka, near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, has since been destroyed by bombing. Of the 26,000 people who lived there, only 2,000 remained. Jess said she planned to return to the Hospitallers Battalion at the end of November. Here are some of the pictures she took on her most recent visit.

m_text : This video can not be playedThe PM was met with cheers from family and staff as he made his resignation speech outside No 10.He said he had tried to persuade colleagues it would be "eccentric" to change leader and blamed the "herd instinct" in Westminster for his exit.He said a timetable for a leadership contest would be announced next week. The winner of that contest will become the next UK prime minister.Mr Johnson faced a mass revolt by ministers over his leadership, sparked by the dramatic resignation of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday evening. He resisted calls to quit - including from newly-appointed Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi - for 48 hours until it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his party and could not continue.Speaking outside Downing Street, he said he had secured an "incredible mandate" in the 2019 general election, winning "the biggest Conservative majority since 1987"."The reason I have fought so hard in the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person, was not just because I wanted to do so, because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you to do what we promised in 2019.""I regret not to have been successful in those arguments," he said but acknowledged that the will of his party was "clear"."In politics, no one is remotely indispensable," he said adding: "I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks."He said he was proud of his achievements in office citing taking the UK out of the EU, the government's response to Covid and rolling out the vaccine programme. He also said he had led "the West in standing up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine".Addressing the Ukrainian people he said: "We in the UK will continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes."President Volodymyr Zelensky praised Mr Johnson for "realising the threat of RF[Russian Federation] monster and always being at the forefront of supporting [Ukraine]."Mr Johnson thanked his wife Carrie and their children as well as the staff of Downing Street and "you, the British people for the immense privilege you have given me"."I know even if things can sometimes seem dark now our future together is golden."He promised that he and his cabinet would to serve the country's interest until a new leader is chosen. Mr Johnson came to power in July 2019 and six months later won a massive majority in a general election.However, he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws and his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher.The PM's speech was brief. But his departure from office won't necessarily be swift.He wanted history to know his resignation was the fault of colleagues and not himself. The "herd", as he called it, had moved quickly, despite winning the biggest majority at the 2019 general election since 1987 and attracting new voters to his party.The subtext is that the coalition of voters - including former Labour supporters - he assembled in 2019 may break up without him to keep it together.He referenced the bad press he received recently, but didn't spend long on any of the mistakes he may have made in office and which provoked mass resignations and a vote of no confidence.He simply acknowledged he hadn't persuaded colleagues that he should remain in office.He will stay on until a new leader is elected, but it is the backbench 1922 committee that will decide the timetable and some MPs want it expedited so he is not still in office until the autumn.With new cabinet ministers in place, he does not seem in a hurry to leave. He will want a legacy that isn't obscured by the chaotic past few days.The Conservative Party will now hold a leadership contest to find a replacement for the departing leader.Attorney General Suella Braverman has said she would "put my name into the ring" and MP Steve Baker have both indicated they will run, with more expected to follow.Some Conservative MPs have expressed concern Mr Johnson would stay in office until the autumn with one saying he had lost "the trust and authority required to continue".Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson should step down immediately and warned that if he did not Labour would hold a vote of no confidence in the government in Parliament.If the government lost the confidence vote, it could lead to a general election, however, in order to pass, a large number of Conservative MPs would have to support the Labour motion.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he "had a very productive" discussion with Mr Putin.It comes after Sri Lanka's energy minister warned at the weekend that the country may soon run out of petrol.On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo to protest against the government."I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel," Mr Rajapaksa tweeted in reference to his conversation with the Russian leader.Mr Rajapaksa also said he had "humbly made a request" for flights between Moscow and Colombo to resume, after the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot suspended services last month."We unanimously agreed that strengthening bilateral relations in sectors such as tourism, trade and culture was paramount in reinforcing the friendship our two nations share," he added.The country has already purchased oil from Russia in recent months to help bolster fuel supplies during the crisis, and the government has signalled that it is willing to buy more from the energy-rich country.Attempts by Mr Rajapaksa to resolve Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, including securing financial support from India and China, have so far failed to end weeks of shortages of fuel, power, food and other essential items.On Sunday, Last week, authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve its dwindling fuel stocks.On Thursday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised its key interest rates by one percentage point to tackle the soaring cost of living in the country.The lending rate was raised to 15.5%, while the deposit rate was increased to 14.5%, the highest in 21 years.It comes as annual inflation hit a record high of 54.6% in June as the cost of food rose by more than 80%.Hundreds of protesters had a day earlier on Wednesday gathered near the parliament building in Colombo as they launched what they called the "final push" to remove Mr Rajapaksa's government.This week, The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter "demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice".Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate one's travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said.Sri Lanka desperately needs the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin for both fuel and tourists, which are both vital to rescuing the country's economy.The island nation has virtually run out of fuel, crippling businesses and public transport.It is struggling to get oil shipments from its usual suppliers in the Gulf or elsewhere due to a lack of foreign currency as well as banking and logistical difficulties.Western nations have imposed restrictions on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is clearly willing to take the risk of triggering displeasure in Western capitals.To add to Colombo's woes, Aeroflot suspended Moscow-Colombo passenger flight services last month after a Sri Lankan court briefly detained one of its planes following a commercial dispute over payment.Russians accounted for almost a fifth of total tourist arrivals in the months before the war started in Ukraine. Even if the flights resume, it may not be easy to attract Russian tourists as they could find it difficult to pay for things while they are on holiday.Several Russian banks have been disconnected from using the SWIFT international payment system and Visa and Master credit cards have suspended Russian operations in response to Moscow's war on Ukraine.Sri Lanka has seen its foreign exchange reserves shrink due to economic mismanagement and the impact of the pandemic.As a result it has struggled to pay for imports of essential goods, including fuel, food and medicine.In May, it defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history after a 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired.The country is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a £3bn bailout.Sri Lanka's government has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a "climate catastrophe". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to "phase down" rather than "phase out" coal after a late intervention by China and India. The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed.While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the "start of a breakthrough", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.However, no firm dates have been set.A flurry of other announcements were made:The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - This is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiatives A Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.Financial organisations controlling $130tn The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming "well below" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.COP stands for "Conference of the Parties", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. "What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss," study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said."It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally," Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.

m_text : Composed of a single runway stretching out into the ocean, Mr Kriss notes that at its pre-pandemic peak, it handled some 700 flights a day, ushering more than 6.3 million international tourists a year to the Indonesian island."Then, one day… nothing," he says with a sweep of his hands. He expected it to last a few weeks, but it went on for two years. In 2020 the island received just one million foreign visitors, almost all before Bali and the rest of the world went into lockdown in March of that year. Then Back in February, Mr Kriss watched anxiously as the first international passenger fight for 24 months arrived from Singapore.The expat, who runs a digital marketing and web design business catering to the local tourism industry, even recorded the event on his mobile phone. Like many in Bali, he was optimistic, especially after the island ditched quarantine rules for overseas arrivals in March.But as the computer screens in his home office call up the latest visitor numbers, he says there's little cause for celebration.In May, Bali "I think it will be 10 years before Bali is back to pre-coronavirus numbers," says Mr Kriss.He believes that foreign travellers are reluctant to visit more remote destinations like Bali due to a perfect storm of the war in Ukraine, high inflation around the world, and lingering concerns about Covid-19.With Dozens of tourism businesses, from shops, to bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and villas sit empty or abandoned, with some even reclaimed by the island's pervasive and all-consuming jungle vegetation. And the streets once crowded with Australian, Asian and European tourists are now still eerily quiet. Made Suryani reopened her small souvenir store close to the Club Med Beach resort near Nusa Dua in April, even though most of the other retail units beside her remain shuttered."Before Covid, in a good month, I could earn more than two million rupiah ($140; £116) a month," she says. That was slightly below "Now sometimes I make 50,000 rupiah in a week. I borrowed money from family to survive, and I don't know how I'm going pay it back," she says.At Nusa Dua's shopping and restaurant mall Bali Collection the area that previously held some of the island's top restaurants is now fenced off and deserted. Of the remaining units, about 80% remain unoccupied."Most of these businesses are gone for good," says Kiran Vijay, who runs a crafts and jewellery store at the development.He says that the site's management have been very helpful, allowing tenants to be remain rent-free for most of the past two years. Yet Mr Vijay adds that tourist footfall is down from as many as 5,000 people a day before the pandemic to just a few hundred today. "They're going to have to lower rents significantly to attract new tenants," he adds.Yet there are some bright spots. Bali's And bookings at Bali's five-star resorts are also surprisingly robust, with high-end hotels seeing a large spike in demand. However, the vast majority of these visitors are domestic travellers from other parts of Indonesia, primarily the capital Jakarta and Surabaya, the second-largest city.Prior to Covid-19, many of these would have considered Bali too expensive. But with foreigners temporarily out of the picture, they're now able to get discounted rates, and special perks like free helicopter rides exclusively available on Indonesian travel booking sites.Many of the hotel staff are however still working on reduced salaries, some down to as little as 10% of pre-pandemic rates. But for them and the resorts, some income is better than none.Meanwhile, many hotel employees and other hospitality workers who were laid off at the start of the lockdowns went back to their home villages to work on the family farm plots. So while some commentators thought that Bali would descend into chaos during the pandemic, life carried on, helped by the island's strong family ties and Hindu culture.Businesses, meanwhile, were able to temporarily suspend operations without fear of bank foreclosure, as most properties in Bali are purchased outright in cash. Julia Lo Bue-Said is chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, an organisation that represents the UK's independent travel agents. She says that while long-haul travel from the UK to destinations such as Bali has been "slower to rebound" compared to holidays within Europe, "the appetite is there and growing"."Long haul will see a significant growth in the next 12-18 months, as despite the cost of living crisis, people are still eager to explore, travel and have something to look forward to, banking life long memories."Mr Kriss is certain that - given time - Bali will return again to its former glory. He says there is simply too much on offer in terms of natural beauty, and the friendly, open and tolerate nature of the Balinese people."Bali will come back strong as ever," he says. "I have no doubt about that. It may take years, but Balinese people are patient, and optimism is part of the fabric of their society - they believe in karma."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : In the UK there have been more than 1,000 confirmed cases in recent weeks.Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but the UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against monkeypox.Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been more than 1,200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year.Two main strains of the virus - west African and central African - are known to exist, and it's the milder one from west Africa which is now circulating in other regions of the world.The unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region, means the virus is now spreading in the community.The It is also advising those infected not to have sex while they have symptoms and use condoms for eight weeks after an infection, as a precaution.James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried.Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles.Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact.While there is currently no available evidence that monkeypox can be spread in sexual fluids, people confirmed to have the virus are advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution.It can also be spread by contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, or by virus-contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothing. Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks.Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in west Africa. Although some of the cases have been seen in gay and bisexual men, anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has monkeypox could potentially get the virus. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said "a notable proportion" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men "so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned".The virus was first identified in a captive monkey and since 1970 there have been sporadic outbreaks reported across 10 African countries. In 2003 there was an outbreak in the US, the first time it had been seen outside Africa. Patients caught the disease from close contact with prairie dogs that had been infected by small mammals imported into the country. A total of 81 cases were reported, but none resulted in deaths.  In 2017, Nigeria experienced the largest known outbreak. There were 172 suspected cases and 75% of victims were men between 21 and 40 years old.Outbreaks can be controlled by infection prevention. Vaccination against smallpox has been proven to be 85% effective in preventing monkeypox.The Antiviral drugs may also help. Health protection teams are contacting people who've come into close contact with confirmed cases and are at high risk. They are offering advice and monitoring them.They are advising anyone else who has been in close contact with someone infected by monkeypox to isolate at home for up to 21 days.Sources: How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : A Google account is essential in order to use a number of its products and services.But the coalition alleges the sign-up process steers users towards options that collect more data.Google told the BBC it welcomed the opportunity to engage with consumer advocates on the topic.The company said that consumer trust depended on honesty and transparency and it had "staked our future success on building ever simpler, more accessible controls and giving people clearer choices. "And, just as important, doing more with less data". The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), which co-ordinates the coalition, claims the language Google uses in the registration process is "unclear, incomplete, and misleading" leading many consumers to pick options that are less privacy-friendly.As a result "tens of millions of Europeans have been placed on a fast track to surveillance when they signed up to a Google account" BEUC claims.The consumer organisation believes sign-up is the critical point at which Google asks users to choose how their account will operate. But the simplest one step "express personalisation" process, it alleges, leaves consumers with account settings that "feed Google's surveillance activities". And the consumer organisation says Google does not provide users with the option to turn all settings 'off' in one click.Instead, BEUC says, it takes five steps and ten clicks to turn off the trackers Google wants to activate on a new account - these relate to web and app activity, YouTube history and personalised advertising on their account.Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of the BEUC, said: "It takes one simple step to let Google monitor and exploit everything you do. If you want to benefit from privacy-friendly settings, you must navigate through a longer process and a mix of unclear and misleading options.Ms Pachl added: "In short, when you create a Google account, you are subjected to surveillance by design and by default. Instead, privacy protection should be the default and easiest choice for consumers."The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires platforms to give users privacy by design and by default.But Google maintains that all options are clearly labelled and designed to be clear and simple to understand.  They are based the company says on extensive research, guidance from regulators and testing.It told the BBC "People should be able to understand how data is generated from their use of internet services. If they don't like it, they should be able to do something about it."BEUC members in the Czech Republic, Norway, Greece, France and Slovenia have filed GDPR complaints against Google with their respective data protection authorities, and groups in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have written to their own authorities about the concerns. The Federation of German Consumer Organisations has sent a warning letter to Google.As this latest action launches, the BBC has been told that a previous investigation prompted by BEUC has made progress.In 2018 Members of the BEUC filed a similar complaint against Google alleging the tech giant breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements through user location tracking. Ireland's Data Protection Commission was appointed the lead authority on the complaints in July 2019. The commission is lead data protection authority for Google and numerous other tech companies with European headquarters in Ireland.It launched an But Ms Pachl said, "it is more than three years since we filed complaints against Google's location-tracking practices and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in charge has still not issued a decision on the case. Meanwhile Google's practices have not changed in essence."However Graham Doyle Ireland's Deputy Data Protection Commissioner told the BBC that "our investigation into Google and location data is well progressed and we expect to send a draft decision to our colleague Data Protection Authorities in the next couple of months for their views".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : He plans to stay in Downing Street until a new Tory leader has been elected to replace him as PM.And he has begun appointing new ministers to replace the ones that quit in protest at his leadership.But some Tory MPs are urging him to leave as soon as possible to avoid government paralysis.Former minister Sir Bob Neill told MPs there was a "serious question mark" over how long a "caretaker" prime minister could stay in place."Might it not be in everybody's interest to speed up the transition as much as possible?" he added.Sir Keir Starmer said that if the Conservative Party did not "get rid" of Mr Johnson immediately then Labour would bring a vote of no confidence "in the national interest"."We can't go on with this prime minister clinging on for months," said the Labour leader, adding: "He needs to go completely... he's inflicted lies, fraud, and chaos in the country."A vote of no confidence would be held in Parliament - if the government lost the vote that could lead to a general election, but this would require a significant rebellion from Conservative MPs to back a Labour motion. It follows a dramatic 48 hours which saw dozens of ministers - including chancellor Rishi Sunak - resigning in protest at his leadership.Mr Sunak's replacement as chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was among the ministers urging the PM to quit.Mr Johnson resisted the calls until Thursday morning, when it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his MPs and that the government could no longer function.Attorney General Suella Braverman and leading backbencher Steve Baker are the first Tory MPs to declare a leadership bid, with others expected to follow.Less than three years ago, Mr Johnson won an historic landslide victory in a general election - but he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws.The revolt this week was triggered by revelations about the prime minister's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher.BBC political editor Chris Mason said Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, has met the prime minister to tell him he has lost the confidence of the party.Is it sustainable for Boris Johnson to carry on as prime minister until the autumn?His supporters will argue that offers some semblance of continuity and stability at a time where there's not much of either. Critics, such as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, are already arguing it isn't sustainable, given the huge number of vacancies in government. Labour also think he should leave as prime minister now and there should be an interim prime minister until the autumn.That argument will rage today.And another will begin: who should be our next prime minister? Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey said it had long been clear Mr Johnson was "unfit to lead our country", adding the "public won't forgive the Conservatives for propping him up for so long".In a tweet, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was a "widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Avabai Wadia, 19, became the first woman from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to pass the bar exam in the United Kingdom. Her success encouraged the Ceylonese government to allow women to study law in the country.This was not the only time Wadia spurred government policies on women's rights. By the time she died in 2005, she had become a globally respected figure in the family planning movement, combining a lawyer's acumen with a dedication to socially uplifting women.Wadia was born in 1913 in a progressive Parsi family in Colombo. After qualifying as a lawyer, she worked in both London and Colombo despite omnipresent "masculine prejudice". She moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) during World War Two and immersed herself in social work, but found her true calling in family planning. "It seems my life work presented itself to me rather than my consciously searching for it," she wrote in her autobiography, The Light is Ours. "I did not feel it a waste not to carry on with a legal career, for law was a fortifying element in all that I undertook."When she began working in the field in the late 1940s, family planning was a taboo topic across much of the world. Aside from stoking opposition from religious conservatives, it also had ugly links with racism and eugenics. "The first time I heard the words 'birth control', I was revolted," Wadia noted. But she was profoundly affected by a female doctor in Bombay who said that Indian women "oscillated between gestation and lactation until death wound up the sorry tale". Despite the threat of social ostracism, Wadia plunged into the cause. In 1949, she helped establish the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), an organisation she would head for 34 years. FPAI's work ranged from promoting contraceptive methods to providing fertility services - the latter gave Wadia "a real sense of satisfaction" since she had suffered miscarriages and had no children. It was in large part due to Wadia's efforts that the Indian government became the first in the world to officially promote family planning policies in 1951-52.Under Wadia, FPAI adopted a decentralised, community-based approach, working with the urban poor and villagers from some of the most impoverished regions of India. This meant that, quite often, the FPAI did "anything but family planning" - it undertook projects ranging from reforestation to road-building. Linking family planning with a holistic agenda of education, skill development and health, Wadia and her team employed creative communication techniques such as singing FPAI's innovative style of work fostered public confidence and led to marked improvements in development indicators. For instance, a project which began in the 1970s in Malur in Karnataka, resulted in reduced infant mortality, a significant increase in the average age of marriage, and the doubling of literacy rates. The project evoked such popular support that villagers took over its management after FPAI exited the scene.Perhaps due to her international upbringing, Wadia brought a global perspective to Indian family planning. Inspired by the success of South Korean mothers' clubs, which bolstered widespread acceptance of family planning in rural areas, she organised close-knit groups where women could discuss pressing social issues ranging from dowry to female under-representation in politics. At the same time, she became a leading figure in the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), spotlighting the unique challenges faced by India in controlling its ballooning demographics.Politics further complicated these challenges. During the Emergency, which was imposed from 1975 to 1977, the Indian government adopted draconian population control measures including forced sterilisation. Wadia condemned this, warning against coercion in family planning programmes and declaring that participation had to be strictly voluntary. Family planning was beginning to show good results but, she lamented, the Emergency "brought the whole programme into disrepute."In the early 1980s, Wadia faced another formidable challenge as president of the IPPF. She locked horns with the administration of US president Ronald Reagan, which cut funding from the country to any organisation which provided or endorsed abortion services. Although the IPPF did not officially promote abortion, some of its affiliates provided abortion services in countries where it was legal. The IPPF refused to cave into US pressure to change this arrangement, resulting in a loss of $17m in funding to its programmes. Wadia ridiculed the Reaganite notion that free market economics would combat population growth. Anyone who believed that, she averred, "has never been anywhere in the developing word - there are too many of the absolute poor, and you just can't leave it to laissez-faire".In many ways, Wadia's career is of pressing relevance to contemporary dilemmas in family planning. In the United States, conservatives have argued that the reversal of abortion rights in Wadia - who was involved in conceptualising India's own abortion law - worried about how abortion could be weaponised in a larger movement against birth control. "Those who try to confuse the public by equating abortion with family planning," she argued, "are trying to destroy human and individual rights."Today in India, political debates abound about "We cannot support disincentives which do not uphold basic human rights," she said in 2000, when Maharashtra state - in a bid to enforce a two-child norm - considered stripping any third-born child of food rations and free primary education. "In practice, anyway, we have found that disincentives don't work."These events have demonstrated that family planning is intrinsically linked to law and politics. Perhaps it was fortuitous, therefore, that India had a pioneering female lawyer as one of the principal architects of its family planning movement.Above all, Wadia's career is a reminder that family planning cannot be divorced from overall socioeconomic development.A few years before Wadia's death, MS Swaminathan - the scientist who led India's Green Revolution, which helped the country achieve food security - paid tribute to this fact. "More than anybody else," he said, Wadia "knew that if our population policies go wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : UK Met Office researchers say that there's now around a fifty-fifty chance that the world will warm by more than 1.5C over the next five years. Such a rise would be temporary, but researchers are concerned about the overall direction of temperatures. It's almost certain that 2022-2026 will see a record warmest year, they say.The Met Office is the UK's national meteorological service.As levels of warming gases in the atmosphere have accrued rapidly over the past three decades, global temperatures have responded by rising in step. In 2015, the That was also the year that political leaders signed the Paris climate agreement, which committed the world to keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C while pursuing efforts keep them under 1.5C.At COP26 in Glasgow last November, governments For the past seven years, global temperatures have stayed at or around that 1C mark, with 2016 and 2020 Scientists say that with around 1C of warming the world is already experiencing significant impacts such as the unprecedented wildfires seen in North America last year, or the This update from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), carried out by the UK Met Office, says that the chances of temporarily going over 1.5C in one of the next five years have never been higher. The study suggests that temperatures between 2022 and 2026 will be between 1.1C and 1.7C higher than pre-industrial levels. The Met Office researchers predict that for any one year in the period, the likelihood of breaching the 1.5C level is around 48%, or close to 50:50."The basic thing that's changing is that the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, are slowly creeping up," said Dr Leon Hermanson from the Met Office, the lead author of the report. "I think people are already quite concerned about climate change and it is worrying, it is showing that we continue to warm the planet and we're getting closer to this first threshold that was set in the Paris agreement - and we need to continue doing everything we can to cut the use of fossil fuels."The researchers say that going over 1.5C for one year isn't the same as a sustained rise where temperatures don't fall below this figure. The likelihood is that if it is exceeded in the next five years, it  will fall below 1.5C again. However there is now little room for complacency."For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise," said Prof Petteri Taalas from the WMO."And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme," he said. According to the study, the Arctic region will likely feel a greater impact of warming over the next five years compared to the rest of the world. The researchers say that the difference in temperatures from the long-term average will be three times as large in these areas.The researchers also believe that one of the coming years will likely break the 2016 and 2020 record for warmest year. That will happen, most likely in an El Niño year. That's a natural, meteorological phenomenon associated with an unusual warming of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific ocean that can impact weather all over the world. "The year we do exceed 1.5 degrees temporarily will probably be an El Niño year," said Dr Hermanson from the Met Office. "It's on top of climate change, kind of like the wiggles on top of the trend, if you like, and the next record year will probably be an El Niño year, like 2016 was."The Follow Matt on Twitter How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This latest announcement means nearly 30,000 flights will have been removed from BA's schedule between April and October this year.The cancellations affect London Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports. The industry has struggled with staff shortages as demand for air travel has rebounded after Covid restrictions. "The whole aviation industry continues to face into significant challenges and we're completely focused on building resilience into our operation to give customers the certainty they deserve," BA said. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said the latest cancellations were a "damning indictment" of BA's failure to manage its summer flight schedule."BA has continued to promote and sell flights it could not fulfil, even as thousands of customers have faced the chaos of cancellations in recent weeks," he said.These flight cancellations come The intention is to reduce the chances of disruption and late-notice cancellations over the summer by making schedules more resilient. Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers would risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights.Ryanair said in a statement that it was against the amnesty, blaming other airlines for the situation they found themselves in."We do not support this latest slot waiver regulation from the UK government, which has been handed out for the benefit of airlines who failed to adequately prepare for the return of air travel post Covid," the statement said. "These slot waivers will lead to fewer flights and reduced connectivity, which will ultimately harm competition and lead to higher fares for hard-pressed UK consumers," it said.Ryanair added that it was operating its full flight schedule this summer, with no disruptions due to staffing shortages.But BA said the new flexibility offered by the amnesty meant it could "further reduce our schedule and consolidate some of our quieter services so that we can protect as many of our holiday flights as possible"."While most of our flights are unaffected and the majority of customers will get away as planned, we don't underestimate the impact this will have and we're doing everything we can to get their travel plans back on track," the airline said.The advance notice means passengers have a chance of re-booking or a refund, and the point is to reduce last-minute disruptions over the next few months.Still, hundreds of thousands of passengers' plans will be disrupted.British Airways hopes this latest wave of summer cancellations will be the last, as it tries to shore up its schedules.  It points out the majority of services will still run as planned.But the return of international travel has not been smooth, with staff shortages still causing serious problems as passenger demand soars. Today's announcement is the latest sign that some airlines - including Easyjet too - have had to scale back their ambitions for what they hoped would be a bumper summer.Long haul flights are unaffected by Wednesday's announcement.BA said it was contacting customers with the offer of a full refund or rebooking with BA or another airline. But the news of cancellations triggered an influx of calls to the company."We're experiencing high call volumes due to current disruption. We'll contact you if your flight has been cancelled," the airline tweeted.BA isn't the only airline to be forced to cancel flights over the busy summer period amid industry-wide disruption.It is understood that EasyJet has been forced to cancel some 10,000 flights between July and September, in a bid to minimise disruption caused by a shortage of staff.The entire aviation sector has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, during which it cut thousands of jobs as the industry ground to a halt.Now that travel has resumed, airlines are seeking to put on almost as many flights as they did before Covid, while finding it difficult to rehire workers. Airlines were expected to announce a wave of cancellations this week ahead of Friday's airport slot amnesty.Ministers told carriers to review their plans after travel chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff.BA said the move would help provide "certainty" to customers. Which? Travel, has said it reported BA to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for neglecting to tell passengers about their right to compensation and failing to reroute customers at the earliest opportunity. Rory Boland from Which? said: "The CAA must take action if BA fails to meet its legal obligations amid this latest round of cancellations."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : Last week, Stuart Kirk, a leader in the bank's responsible investing team, said: "There's always some nut job telling me about the end of the world."At the weekend, HSBC's boss Noel Quinn posted on social media that he did not agree "at all" with the comments.The firm declined to comment on reports that Mr Kirk has been suspended.Mr Kirk, who is global head of responsible investing at the bank's asset management division, was suspended pending an investigation into a speech he made at an event last week, His role, which is based in London, involves considering the impact of investments on environmental, social and governance issues.HSBC came under pressure to sack Mr Kirk after he gave the presentation entitled "Why investors need not worry about climate risk" at a conference on Thursday.In the address he made light of the risks of major floods and said that he had to spend his time "looking at something that's going to happen in 20 or 30 years".During the 15-minute address at the FT Moral Money Summit, Mr Kirk said "Climate change is not a financial risk that we need to worry about.""Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong," a slide shown as part of the presentation said.Later in the presentation, he said: "Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that's a really nice place." Mr Kirk did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.Since the speech, senior HSBC executives have spoken out about the comments.In a LinkedIn post on Saturday, the bank's group chief executive Noel Quinn said he did not agree "at all" with Mr Kirk's remarks. "They are inconsistent with HSBC's strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management," he said.Nuno Matos, chief executive of wealth and personal banking at HSBC, said that he was "in complete agreement" with Mr Quinn and that "the transition to net zero is of utmost importance to us".On Monday, HSBC declined to comment to the BBC on reports that Mr Kirk had been suspended.Instead, a spokesperson shared a statement by HSBC Asset Management chief executive Nicolas Moreau referring to climate change as "one of the most serious emergencies facing the planet"."HSBC Asset Management is committed to driving the transition to a sustainable global economy and has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure its clients' monies are managed for positive long-term environmental and social outcomes," Mr Moreau added.However, both the theme and content of the presentation had been approved within the company, according to the FT.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : All messages that arrive in Anne Ogborn's Trans Rescue email inbox are unique, but this one was particularly unusual. A friend of a friend had met eight young trans women in Mombasa, in a desperate situation. They were staying in what he described as "a one-room holding cell" and risked being attacked if they left. They were now running out of food. Could Anne help?Sitting in her flat in the Netherlands, Anne immediately thought of a trans woman she knew in Kenya named Nuru (not her real name). It had been six months since Anne and her flatmate had provided support to Nuru, when she needed to find a community of trans people in Mombasa. But Nuru's case had been simpler, a tragic story that Trans Rescue hears all too often.Nuru, 26, had known she was transgender from a young age. "I was always with the girls," she says. Until puberty, this hadn't been a problem, but then the people of her village became suspicious of what they saw as an effeminate young man. "I knew I was OK, that there was nothing wrong with me," she says. But her family didn't agree. They beat her and took her to a witchdoctor, who said a spell had been cast on her. That was why she had turned out this way, she said. A year ago Nuru finally managed to run away. She made it to a bus stop and waited. When an open van transporting charcoal came by she clung to the back of it, even though she had no idea where it was heading. She would have gone anywhere. Hours later, when the van slowed down, she saw the open sea and white sands of Mombasa. She found work there as a waitress, but when people discovered she was trans, they shouted abuse and threats. Petrified, Nuru stopped leaving her house. Then one of her friends suggested contacting Anne for advice.Born and raised in the US, Anne has been a vocal advocate of trans rights since the 1980s.Curious to learn about the experiences of gender-diverse people around the world, she even moved to India to live with the Hijra community - a group sometimes referred to as India's "third sex" who have existed in Hindu society for 2,000 years.Back in the US, she had almost given up her work as an activist by the time Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.Watching a president taking steps to ban trans people from the military and to withdraw protections for trans people in the workplace and schools, Anne became increasingly uncomfortable in her country.But it was a leaked US Department of Health memo that proposed defining someone's gender on the basis of their genitalia at birth that was the final straw for her.Anne met another trans woman named Misty Hill who felt the same, and in 2018 they left the US. Anne moved to the Netherlands and Misty to Ireland."Misty and I said to each other, 'When we get ourselves out of the US, we will start an organisation to help others get out,'" Anne says.In 2020, Misty founded an organisation she called TransEmigrate, with support from Anne.They had expected to receive calls from North America, and maybe some countries in South America. But as word spread the messages started coming from all over the world. "We got a quick education on how many trans people are trapped in their countries," says Anne.Last year, Anne re-launched the organisation as Trans Rescue, with a British trans woman in Amsterdam, Jenny List. (Misty now does her own advocacy work in Ireland.) They receive about four requests for help each week, mostly from South America, the Middle East and North Africa.Although the organisation has obtained charitable status, and can rely on the help of a dozen volunteers in several countries, resources are very limited."We reach people through an underground online queer network. Somebody knows somebody," says Anne.Volunteers keep their eyes peeled and ears to the ground. If they hear that a trans person is in trouble they will contact Anne and Jenny in Amsterdam, who will seek to arrange safe temporary accommodation. Anne says the team have poured their own life savings into the operation, but they can only afford to physically move a fraction of those who contact them to a different country - 15 people so far. "Moving people safely and legally is hard and slow," Anne says. But in many cases they move them within countries. It may also be that what callers need most is information."Sometimes people just want to be made aware of their options," she says. "We work in countries where people are on the run because their existence is illegal. We are an essential service for trans people." One person Trans Rescue helped was Nuru, arranging for her to move to a safe location, and putting her in contact with other trans women in Kenya. Nuru asked if she could volunteer for Trans Rescue, so when Anne heard about the eight trans women in trouble in Mombasa, she knew who to call.Nuru was happy to return the favour, but she wasn't prepared for what she saw: the eight of them were penned into a tiny, airless room, baking in the unforgiving Mombasa heat."They were burning," says Nuru. "They were traumatised."The group had been housed there by a man who found them on a beach and took pity on them. They were clearly survivors of sustained physical and sexual abuse by several men.They had barely any food and would sleep sitting up in their room, desperate to remain alert in case they were found and attacked.Nuru called Anne and Jenny, who immediately arranged for them to be moved, and provided with money for food and rent.Tragically, they still weren't safe in their new location. Just days ago, two were attacked by a group of men as they were walking on the beach, and one of them was killed.For Anne, this underscores the need for a refuge for trans people, Eden House, to be located in a large Kenyan city.It will not be a hiding place, like the secret safehouses Trans Rescue has used so far, but a spacious building where Anne hopes trans people can live openly, and without fear.It would be the first of its kind in the world, she says."We would like the house to become an institution that is large enough to form a kind of bubble of trans acceptance around itself."We want it to be a place where trans men and women from other parts of the world can come and live."If we have a safe building in Kenya, we can get people in truly dangerous places to safety."A house has been found, the task now is to find 10,000 euros (£8,600) to buy it and carry out basic repairs.The seven surviving trans women in Mombasa would be the first residents. But it would be open to people from all over the world, Anne says, such as a trans man they helped to escape from Saudia Arabia this month, who might have been killed had he stayed longer.One day Anne would like to be able to provide therapy for those who need it, but for now the focus is on physical survival."We're ordinary people. We want to live our lives."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : From the street, Ken Patten's unassuming semi-detached home looked much like any other house on his estate, or indeed on any post-war estate in Britain.But inside, musicians forged the future sound of British pop on synthesisers in the living room, an electronic drum kit in the master bedroom, and even a DIY vocoder - that produces a robot-type singing effect - made out of old RAF microphones and toilet rolls in the downstairs extension."It was totally chintz and had enormous sofas with flower patterns - a typical middle-class Sheffield suburban house with a big thick pile carpet," Martyn Ware recalls of the house. "Really comfy and lovely, with a little conservatory at one end."Ware would go on to form The Human League and Heaven 17. But he made the journey to Ken's house on the outskirts of Sheffield with his first band, The Future, in 1977 after they put an ad in a local paper seeking somewhere to record.When they arrived, they expected Ken to take them into a studio, perhaps in his garage. Instead, he told them they would be recording in the lounge."I said, 'Where do we put the synths and stuff?' He said, 'Oh, just put them on the coffee table'. He brought out his four-track recorder and, as I recall, a tiny mixing desk. We were half sat on the chintzy sofa, half sat on the floor."It was the most unlikely genesis of something really pretty avant garde that I can imagine. It's much more weird than being in a fancy studio. This was like Coronation Street, you know?"Ware's forthcoming autobiography has a section dedicated to Ken's improbably-named Studio Electrophonique, while Pulp's Jarvis Cocker fondly remembered it in his recent book Good Pop Bad Pop.Meanwhile, a documentary titled A Film About Studio Electrophonique had its premiere at the Sheffield Doc/Fest last week.The film's director Jamie Taylor says the home studio had "a very Heath Robinson home-made ethos to it", with most of the recording taking place in Ken's home-built extension."He did have some very good cutting-edge equipment at the time," Taylor explains. "He also had some very strange contraptions that he made himself. It [the studio] was very small, and some of it extended into other rooms."In Taylor's documentary, Cocker recalls marvelling at a CCTV system that Patten had rigged up to allow them to watch their drummer in the bedroom while they were downstairs. That was in 1981, and Cocker later thrust the resulting demo tape into the hands of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, leading to their first radio session before they had signed a record deal.Ware says his band's recording was "massively important" for their progression. They took the tape of what he describes as "soundscapes with vocals on" to record labels in London. Most showed them the door after five minutes - but some saw their potential."They said, 'You need to go away and write some structured songs, but this is very interesting and please come back to us when you've got more stuff'." They did, and eventually signed a contract with one of the labels that showed an interest in the Studio Electrophonique demo, Virgin Records.Another band to make early recordings in Ken's house was Vice Versa, who would later morph into ABC. As well as the budding pop groups, Ken catered for Hawaiian guitar groups, folk acts, ranting political singers - and anyone else who was prepared to pay £15 to record there."I think his wife tolerated his hobby," Taylor explains. "But there were certain rules about, if the bands came in, they had to take their shoes off. They weren't allowed to use the toilet upstairs. I think Jarvis said there was polythene across the bed so they couldn't soil the eiderdown."It was a bizarre mix of a cutting-edge studio and a suburban house. One of the bands said that at four o'clock every afternoon, whatever stage of recording they were at, it stopped when his wife came in with a cup of tea for Ken and his heart pills."Ware, too, discovered that domestic routines took priority."We got to the end of the first day and we were really hitting our stride," he says. "It got to about six o'clock and Mrs Patten came in and said, 'Ken, your dinner's on the table'. He said, 'Oh, I'm sorry lads, we're going to have to stop now'."We were in the middle of something really profound and heavy," he says with a laugh. "But, 'Your dinner's on the table, it won't wait'."Behind the ordinary façade of an RAF veteran and panel beater, Ken was an eccentric British technological tinkerer, the documentary shows.He went water-skiing with a speedboat he built himself (and which exploded, injuring his daughter). He recorded his own radio-style sci-fi sketches, and made silent comedy routines with a cine film club."The things that we found out, it did seem like he was a kind of Wallace and Gromit or Caractacus Potts type," says Taylor."He had this outwardly quite normal and dull existence, a quite suburban existence, yet he had these bizarre hobbies. The music was just one of them."Taylor himself is following Ken's DIY ethos. He is an English teacher and filmed the documentary with an iPad and cheap plug-in mic, before getting some funding to edit it professionally.He approached people like Cocker, Ware and actor Sean Bean - who grew up on the same Ballifield estate as Ken - with little expectation that they would agree to take part. They all said yes.Taylor had made one film before, about a working men's club football team, also on his iPad and without funding or much idea of whether anyone would want to watch it."No-one's going to come and commission you to make a film in Sheffield if you're an unknown film-maker," he says. "So we just got on with it, really. We took Ken's lead."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : That's just one line from rapper, TV chef, actor and radio DJ Or should we say, For the uninitiated, Zuu (whose full name is Zuhair Hassan) stars alongside his childhood best friends Tubsey and Hyder as they cook up a storm of diverse dishes for a celebrity guest each week from their caravan kitchen.Now in its third series, the show has been building momentum since it first aired in 2020. While much of the show's appeal relies on the tempting dishes and comic banter between the trio - and their guinea pig guests - there's clearly a drive to push the envelope, too.All three of the show's hosts come from refugee backgrounds, something Zuu also referenced in his Bafta speech."Our main thing when picking a guest is... about representation and having a fair spread of different people, different voices that we kind of give life to because the food we cook is based on the guests," Big Zuu explains. "So when we cook food for people from different backgrounds, we tap into different cultures and cuisines."Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, tells the BBC: "Refugees, like the family of Big Zuu, are ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances who simply want the chance to live in peace, away from the war, conflict and violence that shattered their entire lives."Refugees have so much to contribute to their new communities, across many spheres of society and it is vitally important they have a voice."Previous guests on Big Zuu's Big Eats include Jimmy Carr, Mo Gilligan, Judi Love and Harry Redknapp, while the likes of Mel B and Johnny Vegas are sitting down to dinner in series three.Zuu's also keen that the food featured - which runs the gamut from smoked eel sarnies to Mama Zuu's jollof rice - is accessible and affordable, especially during the current cost of living crisis."How many people actually say, 'You know what, I'm gonna go cook what I just saw on Channel 4 or on Saturday Kitchen?" the self-taught cook asks."No disrespect to my peers [but] sometimes the recipes and ingredients… are not accessible at home. For our show, it's very important [that you can] make it at home [and can] afford to make it. Even when we do specialist dishes, we like to break the mould and just say: 'If you ain't got this [ingredient], use something else.'"Zuu, who grew up on a council estate, adds: "I feel like sometimes hearing from our voices is a bit more understandable than hearing it from a… very rich, middle-class person."Critics agree. But not everybody is a fan of its sometimes frenetic energy. "It's really quite fast-paced, there's a lot going on, it's a little too much for me," Tubsey and Hyder, who Zuu nicknames the Arabian Chuckle Brothers, say it's crucial they are allowed to be authentic - what you see is what you get."Me and Tubsey especially, we were just clueless [when the show first started] but they [the producers] just said: 'You guys be yourselves'," Hyder tells me.Zuu says that's why the Bafta recognition was so important. "People like us don't win it. As much as it was a time for celebration, it was a time to appreciate what we've done. It was important for us to reflect on why we were there and what we represent. "I felt it was only right for us to use that moment to touch on the struggles that we had to get here and hopefully inspire other people in the process."The ultimate cookery crash course. Stacey Dooley, Big Zuu and Chef Kay Kay test out ten rookie cooks. They'll live and work together - but who'll win the foodie trip of a lifetime?He says people still come up to him to talk about it."I definitely get a lot of people stopping me, talking to me about it, telling me how it affects them, telling me they play the speech every morning to motivate them. I get stopped by all walks of life, by people who are white, black, Asian, from all types of backgrounds, people who are posh, people from the hood. It doesn't matter."The lads still seem to have their feet on the ground - although Hyder has become a bit of a diva by all accounts.Zuu jokes: "If Hyder gets to the set and there's no cheese toastie, he doesn't film."Hyder protests: "I don't say I won't film but you'll just get a lot more out of us if there's a cheese toastie on set!"Unsurprisingly, their parents are thrilled at their success.Hyder, whose family comes from Kurdistan and who previously worked in his dad's garage, explains: "They just want us to make something of ourselves. We can then return the help to them for giving us the opportunity... it's just about trying to pay them back."Zuu says his mum, who came from Sierra Leone when she was four months pregnant, is "eternally happy... she just wants me to buy a house" while Tubsey jokes that he's "getting the pressure to get married now" from his mum.Before that, they all have more ambitions to fulfil. Zuu - who is AJ Tracey's cousin - is continuing to make music and wants to pursue more acting work (he's in new sitcom Sneakerhead on Dave), while Hyder is contemplating running for election as an MP one day. Tubsey, whose family are from Iraq and Iran, wants to get into business, maybe something combined with his love of food.All three agree that their favourite guest on the show so far is comedian Rosie Jones, who took part in the first series.And Zuu's ultimate guest choice? For the Liverpool fan, it can only be one man, Jurgen Klopp.Bratwurst anyone?How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedAs Japan struggles to deal with the hottest early summer on record, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the country must quickly restart more of its nuclear power plants.For the first time ever June temperatures broke through 40C last week - and Japan's power stations are struggling to keep up. But 11 years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster the push to restart Japan's nuclear plants remains deeply unpopular. At the Fukushima site they are preparing to release over a million tonnes of treated cooling water in to the Pacific Ocean. The BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes went back to the plant to meet local fishing communities who are ardently opposed to the release of the water.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The play will be "set within the world and mythology of Stranger Things" and be made by director Stephen Daldry and producer Sonia Friedman, Netflix said.It will be one of a number of new projects to be overseen by Stranger Things creators the Duffer brothers.The screen spin-off will be "based on an original idea" from the pair.This video can not be playedNetflix gave few details, but Ross Duffer recently told the Happy Sad Confused podcast that the series would "1,000% different" from the current show.Matt Duffer added: "I've read these rumours that there's gonna be an Eleven spin-off, that there's gonna be a Steve and Dustin spin-off, or that it's another number."That's not interesting to me because I feel like we've done all that. We've spent I don't know how many hours exploring all of that. So it's very different."It is not known whether the stage play will also take a different direction or adapt the existing series. There are also no details about whether it is likely to launch in the UK given that it is being led by a British pair.Friedman has staged a number of major shows in the West End and Broadway, including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Jerusalem and The Inheritance.Daldry, who made his name directing Billy Elliott, won a string of theatre awards for The Inheritance, his last major play, which opened in London in 2018.Wednesday's Netflix announcement came days after the release of the final part of the fourth and penultimate season of Stranger Things. It has become the first season of an English-language programme to be watched for more than one billion hours on the streaming giant.That success has led the company to announce a string of new projects to be masterminded by the Duffers.Netflix revealed the brothers had launched their own production firm called Upside Down Pictures - named after Stranger Things' nightmarish realm.Their company will also make a new series based on Japanese manga and anime hit Death Note - which was already turned into a Netflix film in 2017 - and an adaptation of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy novel The Talisman.Netflix co-chief executive and chief content officer Ted Sarandos said: "Matt and Ross are an exceptionally unique talent with a vision so crisp and clear."They are all about the details - it's no accident that Stranger Things has pierced the zeitgeist to become the epic pop culture phenomenon it is today."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : People are experiencing rolling blackouts of up to six hours a day and are having to face a bitterly cold winter with an erratic and unreliable power supply. A typical day of what the state-run power company Eskom euphemistically calls "Stage six load shedding" consists of waking up to no power, driving to work through congested roads because the traffic lights aren't working, being pummelled by the din of generators at the work place, and then finding power has been cut once more when you get back home. It's enough to make George Landon, a resident of South Africa's main city Johannesburg, want to leave the country."I had a job interview in London. I'm booking my flight tomorrow because of the state we are in. Unfortunately I love my country, but the country needs to love us as well," he says.Poor management and corruption at Eskom mean South Africa has been experiencing power cuts for many years but this is poised to be the worst yet. The country is fast approaching last year's figure of 2,521 gigawatt hours of electricity cut from the grid. So far, Eskom has shed 2,276 gigawatt hours, and it's only July. To prevent a total grid collapse, Eskom cuts power to different parts of the country at a time.Last week Eskom entered stage six for the first time since December 2019, meaning it had to cut 6,000 megawatt hours to prevent a nationwide blackout. There are eight stages of load shedding - each stage means 1,000 megawatt hours must be cut. Many residents have to go up to six hours a day without power.Eskom tells people when the lights will go off in their area, but it does not always adhere to its schedule. Sometimes, it may happen earlier or later. The power cuts have been exacerbated by industrial action by Eskom workers who went on strike last week. Wage negotiations between Eskom and workers from three unions broke down, prompting them to down tools, severely hampering operations and vital maintenance work.  Eskom boss Andre de Ruyter blasted the striking workers, calling the industrial action "illegal" and accusing them of holding the country "hostage". Eskom workers are classified as essential in South Africa and are not permitted to strike.  National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi, however, took umbrage, saying workers were "almost being pitted against the public" while the government was not acknowledging that its "major failures" had triggered the crisis.A Furthermore, Eskom is constrained by a massive $26bn (£22bn) debt, which is compounded by the fact that it has old, inefficient power stations that require constant work to keep them running. Two new power stations that it has built have been beset by cost overruns, design flaws and ongoing delays. As a result, they are not generating enough electricity. In May this year, Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe signed three deals to buy power from independent producers, seen as a step towards ending Eskom's monopoly on power. They are considered the largest renewable solar and battery combined projects in the world. While progress is being made in plugging the generating capacity shortfall, South Africans have been warned to expect load shedding for another two to three years.  The power cuts have had a severe affect on the economy and are likely to stifle economic growth and further deepen the unemployment crisis, which is a staggering 34.5%. For Boitumelo Mokoena, who runs a small furniture manufacturing company in Alexandra, a bustling Johannesburg township, having no electricity is a death knell for her business, especially as it comes after the Covid lockdowns."When there's no power the big machines must stop. It has affected our timelines. We've had instances where clients had deadlines and we could not deliver on time. "Small businesses are already struggling in the market place, and if you don't deliver it's even worse," Ms Mokoena says.Small and medium businesses are the engine of South Africa's ailing economy.They comprise at least 98% of businesses in the country, and employ between 50% and 60% of South Africa's workforce, "For every stage of load shedding there is about 250 million rand ($15.3m; £12.9m) lost on that particular day," says energy expert Lungile Mashele. "So you can imagine that on stage six, you're basically looking at around 1.5bn rand ($92m) shaved from the economy." Johannesburg resident Tebogo Kolea can't hide her frustration."I'm very angry because [household] budgeting for us is a problem right now. We can't be paying for electricity and after every two hours there is load shedding again," she says.

m_text : This video can not be playedHe says there were about 100 customers in the shop at the time. "We were working. There were a lot of people in the shop, but I don't remember anything after that," he says. At 16:00 local time, a Russian missile struck the mall in the centre of the city. At least 18 people were killed and 59 left injured. The toll is expected to rise.  "The shopping centre is not a place of danger for the Russians. We thought we were far away from the frontier," Maksym says.  He has a shrapnel wound, concussion and multiple scratches.His wife, Viktoria, sits by his side in the hospital. They just celebrated their anniversary and it is her birthday next week.  She was at home when the explosion struck and instantly tried to call her husband, fearing the worst.  "He picked up his phone and said he was in the centre of the fire," she says.  Viktoria's neighbours helped her get to the site of the shopping centre.  "Everything was black and then the neighbours said he was in the hospital," she says.  "We didn't invade anyone, we just want to live," Maksym adds.  In the next room, a man who gave his name as Mykola remembers waking up in the ruins next to his wife.  "We tried to get out. I helped my wife and helped a girl on our way. I saw people lying around, some weren't responding. The fire was getting bigger and I was walking on glass," he adds.  His wife is also in the hospital and is receiving treatment. Mykola makes sure he messages her every two hours.  "I didn't think this would happen," he says. "I thought they were trying to ruin our infrastructure. I didn't even think they would hit a shopping centre. There are women and children. It's a safe place." That safe place is now a mangled mess. Rescuers are still at the scene trying to pick apart the debris, which is all that's left of the site.The shopping mall site is in a busy part of town - approximately 36,000 people live in within 2km. It had a food court and a number of stores that sold a range of goods - from clothes to jewellery.One Kremenchuk resident, Mischa, says he has been to the shopping mall a few times since the invasion. It's a big mall that closes during an air raid, he says. "There was always lots of people there," he adds. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the attack a "brazen terrorist act", while the leaders of the G7 group of richest nations said that indiscriminate attacks on civilians were a war crime. A memorial to those who have died has been set up next to the building's remains. A steady stream of people are coming to light a candle, lay flowers and pay their respects to those killed. Others are waiting to hear of news of those missing. A woman named Anna had tears in her eyes as she told the BBC that she had friends working in the shopping centre's pharmacy. "My friends there are all young and under 30. My son was meant to be there," she said.  "What are they doing? We are going to get killed. I want them [Russia] to take responsibility."

m_text : Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told the BBC she was receiving reports of between 200 to 300 war crimes a day.She admitted that many trials would be held in absentia, but stressed that it was "a question of justice" to continue with the prosecutions.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. It denies all war crimes allegations.Speaking to the BBC's World Service Outside Source programme, Ms Venediktova warned that Russian soldiers who killed, tortured or raped civilians "should understand that it's only a question of time when they all will be in court".She said that although her team was working in regions across Ukraine, it was unable to investigate all cases "properly and effectively" because of a lack of access to some people and areas. This was an apparent reference to Ukraine's territories occupied by Russian troops.In May, Ms Venediktova said that about 600 suspects had already been identified and 80 prosecutions had begun.The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was Ukraine says it has uncovered multiple mass graves in Bucha, Borodyanka and other towns near the capital Kyiv that were briefly seized by Russian troops.The International Criminal Court has described Ukraine as a "crime scene", dispatching its largest team of detectives ever to the country to assist in multiple investigations.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. On the ground, Ukraine's military said Russian troops were preparing for an offensive in the eastern Donetsk region, shelling several towns.Russia captured nearly all of the neighbouring Luhansk region over the weekend, part of its attempts to seize the wider Donbas area.In its update, Ukraine's military said its forces were under intense pressure but had so far held off Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said "artillery from our Western partners had started working very powerfully, so the losses of the occupiers will only increase".This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Temperatures hit 32.7 (91F) in south-east England on Friday, triggering an official heatwave, as hot air spread up from Spain, Portugal and north Africa.Experts have said it's rare to see temperatures this high at this point in June. Yes, Britain has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century. In the past three decades, the The 10 hottest years since 1884 have all happened since 2002. And none of the coldest years has been recorded this century.In 2019, Cambridge saw the hottest temperature ever captured in the UK: 38.7C. The summer of 2018 was the UK's second-warmest - shared with 1995 - since 1884. The hottest was in 1976. A heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year.In the UK, the Met Office declares a heatwave when it records at least three days in a row with maximum temperatures exceeding a set temperature.That threshold varies by county.Heatwaves usually happen in summer when high pressure develops over an area. They can also bring so-called "tropical nights" - when night-time temperatures fail to drop below 20C. That can make it hard to sleep at night and the body can suffer, as it fails to sufficiently cool down.The Met Office says it's not clear whether heatwaves are becoming more frequent because of their sporadic nature. Climate change is This has brought more extreme weather, including record-breaking high temperatures across the world.Periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns, In the UK, A That trend is predicted to continue. It's possible that by 2100, Hot weather can be dangerous particularly for the vulnerable, including elderly people, children and people with underlying health conditions.Spending too much time in high temperatures or in the sun, There are also indirect effects like poorer mental health and an increase in accidents such as car crashes and drownings. In August 2003, 20,000 people died following a heatwave in Europe lasting 10 days, The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.Where possible, you should modify your routine and behaviour to adapt to the heat. If you can, travel in the morning or evening when temperatures are lower.

m_text : This video can not be playedRoads have been cut off, with 18 evacuation orders in western Sydney alone and warnings of more to come."This is a life-threatening emergency situation," Stephanie Cooke, emergency services minister for the state of New South Wales, said.Australia was hit by major flooding in March, killing 20 people, many in NSW."We are now facing dangers on multiple fronts - flash flooding, riverine flooding and coastal erosion," Ms Cooke told a media briefing. Her warning came as the Bureau of Meteorology said up to 350mm of rain had hit certain areas, risking flooding along the Nepean river.Sydney's main dam had also started to spill overnight - a further concern for the authorities.Ms Cooke said this was a "rapidly evolving situation" and warned that people should be "prepared to evacuate at short notice".There had been 83 flood rescues by emergency services in the past 24 hours alone, she said."It unfortunately shows that people aren't necessarily heeding the advice that we continue to put out multiple times a day in relation to this flooding event," Ms Cooke said."I'm respectfully asking people to avoid non-essential travel at this time."Her warnings come as an unnamed man was killed after falling out of a kayak on the Parramatta River in western Sydney. Emergency officials attempted to revive the man after he was spotted struggling in the water by a member of the public, but he died at the scene. Experts say the flooding emergency has been worsened by climate change and a La Niña weather phenomenon. A La Niña develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards Indonesia. In their place, colder waters come up to the surface.In Australia, a La Niña increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones and cooler daytime temperatures.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : His parents recently petitioned police in Guangxi province to investigate.But a local health bureau refused to look into the case, saying he'd been taken away due to "social reallocation" under China's former one-child policy. The case has sparked outrage towards the authorities on social media.Many online were critical of the strict rules under the one-child policy at the time, calling the incident a "blatant case of human trafficking". It also comes after recent news of a Chinese mother who was filmed locked up in a village hut, which sparked discussion about human trafficking in China's rural areas. Earlier this week, a letter from the local health bureau in Quanzhou county went viral on Chinese social media. The letter was written in response to a couple's request for an investigation to be opened into the case of their seventh child, whom they suspected had been abducted in the 1990s.The couple - surnamed Tang and Deng - had called for police to look into a group of local former officials. According to local news outlets, the parents said they had never stopped looking for their child, and had sent numerous complaints to various government departments. On 1 July, the local health bureau replied and said an investigation would not be conducted, as the child had not been abducted, but taken away by the then authorities for "social reallocation". The authority also added there was no record of the "whereabouts of children who were reallocated for the convenience of family planning work rolled out across the country", according to state media outlet the Global Times.The letter quickly went viral, as many condemned the policy and others highlighted the use of the term "social reallocation". "What do they mean social reallocation? Isn't this human trafficking?" one person asked. Others shared personal stories of how their families had been affected over the decades by the now-abandoned one-child policy which was introduced in 1979 to slow China's booming population growth. Former editor in chief of the Global Times Hu Xijin was among those who weighed in on the matter, calling out the "indifferent" language used in the government statement and how the incident had gone on to stir a "public crisis". In an interview with news site Caixin, the child's mother claimed that the family had already paid some fines to their local official for having more than one child. Yet her child was taken away despite this, she alleges. The hashtag #QuanzhouOverBornKidCaseBeenReportedtoGovernment gained almost 60 million views as millions online began discussing the case and backlash ensued. On 5 July, the Guilin People's Government - the administration which Quanzhou falls under - put out a letter saying the Quanzhou health bureau had "improperly handled a petition that aroused social concern". They added that an investigation into the case would be opened, and that the director and deputy director of the health bureau would be suspended for ignoring the petition and for "administrative inaction". Under the one-child policy imposed in 1979, and later the two-child policy, families faced hefty fines and other punishments for having more children. The government generally enforced it by providing financial and employment incentives to those who complied, making contraceptives widely available and fining those who violated the rules.More coercive measures such as forced abortions and mass sterilisations were also used at times.According to To try to arrest a steep decline in birth rates, on 1 January 2016 China scrapped its one-child policy for a two-child policy. That was scrapped in 2021, allowing couples to have up to three children butHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The spacecraft has just detected a Magnitude 5 tremor - the biggest event yet in its three years of operation on the Red Planet.But InSight is now picking up very little energy through its solar panels.Dust covers the arrays, and winter is approaching.Lower light levels will signal the end of the mission.Equipment, such as the probe's robotic arm, is about to be locked in position and turned off.The all-important seismometer can be put in a reduced working mode for a while, coming on for only part of a Martian day, or Sol, and then perhaps only every other day. Mission managers will keep this up for as long as they can, but they know time is not on their side."[In July] we anticipate our seismometer to be turned off, not because we want to turn it off but unfortunately we don't have the energy to run it," said Kathya Zamora Garcia, InSight's deputy project manager at the US space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California."At the end of the calendar year, we do anticipate having to conclude all InSight operations," she told reporters.The mission, which landed in a flat landscape known as Elysium Planitia in 2018, has transformed our understanding of the interior of the Red Planet.Before its sophisticated French-UK seismometer package began returning data, we had a "really fuzzy picture" of how Mars' different layers were organised.Now, after using the vibrations from more than 1,300 Marsquakes to "image" the planet's deep geology, scientists can be much more certain about the thickness and composition of the planet's crust, mantle and core."What InSight has done is shone a light on the inside of Mars," said principal investigator Bruce Banerdt, also from JPL."Whereas we know a lot about the outside of Mars - we've taken images, we've taken spectra, we've made measurements of the surface of Mars for the last 50 years - InSight's been the first mission to shine a light beneath the surface of Mars and show us what the rest of the planet looks like."Scientists knew that at some point Martian dust would settle on InSight's solar wings to block out the Sun's rays. It's the perennial blight against which all solar-panelled missions to the Red Planet must battle.When InSight touched down on 26 November 2018, its black-coloured, sparkling clear wings were producing about 5,000 Watt hours per sol. Today, coloured red from all the dust, they can produce only one-tenth as much at approximately 500 Watt hours per sol."We use an electric oven as a marker to get people to understand," said Zamora Garcia. "So, when we first landed, it was about an hour, 40 minutes or so where we could run an electric oven. Nowadays, we could probably run that for approximately 10 minutes max."Ingenious efforts have been made to try to clean the wings. InSight has a scoop and by sprinkling dust on to the wings, it had the effect of knocking off some of the dust already in place. The trick has been used successfully six times to extend operations, but it won't save the mission.Scientists will hope InSight can add a few more events to its tally of 1,313 detected Marsquakes. Who knows, they may even get to see another Magnitude 5 before everything on the mission shuts down.The M5 was detected on the Martian morning of 4 May. For context, a tremor of that scale here on Earth would definitely be noticed and might even cause some minor damage to loosely constructed buildings. Mission team-members are still analysing the data but they think the Marsquake occurred close to, but not exactly in, a region of the planet called Cerberus Fossae. Cerberus Fossae, which is about 1,500km to the east of InSight's location, has been the source for all of the bigger tremors witnessed by the probe. The terrain there is heavily faulted as a result of past volcanic activity on Mars. Two huge parallel fissures run across the landscape for 1,000km.The vast majority of quakes on Mars likely stem from thermal anomalies in the crust. As the planet cools and shrinks, its rocks will break along lines of weakness, releasing the seismic waves InSight's seismometer was designed to pick up."InSight has been an incredible mission for us, and it's given us a glimpse of Mars that we couldn't get from any other spacecraft in our Nasa Mars fleet," said Lori Glaze, the director of Nasa’s planetary science division."Understanding Mars and studying Mars' interior structure answers key questions about the early formation of the rocky planets in our inner Solar System, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Earth's Moon, and Mars, as well as helping us understand rocky [planets beyond our Solar System]."

m_text : About as much as eight months' worth of rain has come down in just four days, bringing parts of Australia's largest city to a standstill. Experts say no single factor can explain this extreme weather, pointing instead to warmer oceans and saturated soils as contributing factors.But conspiracy theorists aren't buying it. On social media, they blame the extreme rainfall on "cloud seeding" and "weather manipulation".There is no evidence to back up such theories, but this hasn't prevented falsehoods from reaching thousands of people online.Cloud seeding is a real thing. It involves manipulating existing clouds to try and help them produce more rain or snow. This is done by firing small particles (usually silver iodide) into clouds. Water vapour gathers around the particles and eventually falls as precipitation.The technique has been around for decades. It's not infallible, but it's been used all around the world to - for example - help irrigate crops.But there is no evidence to suggest cloud seeding has anything to do with the current rainfall in Sydney. That hasn't stopped some TikTok users from denouncing "weather engineering".They say it's all part of a government plan to "weaponise" the weather against its own people - a "The idea that this is happening on a widespread scale, and that there is some motive to manipulate the weather is a complete myth," says Dr Ellie Gilbert, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.And yet, this myth seems to have found an audience on various social media platforms. Many of the accounts seen by the BBC posting this type of content have also shared other conspiracy theories involving global warming, Covid vaccines, and the Moon landings.Some conspiracy theorists have been sharing a 2016 news report from the Australian TV network 7News - which has now been watched thousands of times.In it, the newsreader reports on concerns by Tasmanian residents that But a probe by the Tasmanian government found that cloud seeding did not contribute to or worsen the heavy rains - a conclusion since backed by independent scientists and experts."We don't have a co-ordinated effort to change the weather, because it's just physically and financially unfeasible," says Dr Gilbert, who adds that even if cloud seeding played a role, it would have "an absolutely miniscule effect."There is A In Australia, a La Niña increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones, and cooler daytime temperatures.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : It took Vadym Bobryntsev four days to bury his wife, he said. It was the middle of March in Mala Rohan, a village near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the ground was frozen. The village was under occupation by the Russian army, so Vadym went out periodically from their shell-damaged house to dig in a far corner of the garden shaded by apricot and quince trees. After 45 years of marriage, 69-year-old Vadym, alone, lifted his wife Iryna into a makeshift casket, folded her hands over her chest, lowered her into the grave, covered the casket with a corrugated tin sheet, to protect her, and filled in her grave with earth.Two and a half months later, in early June, a local prosecutor from the city of Kharkiv drove out to Mala Rohan with a small team to dig Iryna up. First, the team walked around and through the remains of Vadym's house, interviewing him and taking pictures of the place where the shell had hit. After the inspection of the house, Vadym led the prosecutor along a path through the garden to the grave. The team took photographs, soil samples, and detailed notes, and watched attentively as two volunteers began to dig. Now the sun was beating down on Mala Rohan and the earth came loose easily. When the casket was raised up and ready to be opened, Vadym, holding a picture of his wife pressed between his palms, ducked under the branches of the apricot tree and walked toward the house so he would not see.The local prosecutor, Maksym Klymovets, was at Vadym's house to help determine whether the Bobryntsevs were the victims of a war crime - a specialist field in which Klymovets and his colleagues had no experience until Russia invaded Ukraine, three months ago. Klymovets, who has cropped dark hair and a neatly-trimmed beard, was accompanied by two forensic police officers, another officer who took notes, two civilian witnesses drawn from the village - in accordance with Ukrainian law - and two local volunteers to dig the grave. "This is totally new work for us," Klymovets said. "We are learning on the job."After about three hours, Klymovets declared the evidence-gathering complete for this visit and Iryna's casket was loaded into the back of a van to be transported to the morgue. Her death would be recorded as an alleged war crime - one of nearly 16,000 such cases now open across the country, including more than 1,000 in the Kharkiv region. There is no precedent for what is happening now in Ukraine - a large-scale war crimes investigation being conducted as the war is going on, by the nation under attack. In Kharkiv, ordinary local prosecutors have found themselves thrust into complex investigations for which they have little or no experience. In the field, they wear vests, some hand-painted, which say "War Crimes Prosecutor", though this job does not technically exist. They are working tirelessly to examine and catalogue scenes of shellings, missile strikes, and murders, and sometimes scenes of brutal crimes against their countrymen.The work is slow and methodical. Klymovets' team analysed the scene in Mala Rohan carefully, and they will return. Back in the city, in an apartment completely wrecked by a shell, another team measured and photographed every piece of damage, down to a small piece of glass embedded in a door. On the outskirts of a different village, yet another team went classroom to classroom in an agricultural college, tracing the path of a shell that had smashed through each dividing wall without exploding. As they go, the prosecutors narrate their observations in fine detail for the benefit of a video camera. They are following freshly-issued guidelines, and they work with the attentive diligence of people who are new to a task.The Ukrainians are being supported by some international expertise - explosives technicians from Slovakia; forensics experts from France; war crimes experts from the UK; a 42-member team from the International Criminal Court. But the sheer number of war crimes investigations now open means the vast majority are being carried out by Ukrainian teams. In Kharkiv, before the invasion, there were only 23 people qualified to investigate war crimes, so the region had no choice but to delegate the power to ordinary prosecutors. "Everyone is involved to the maximum," Klymovets said. "We are working seven days a week." But running war crimes investigations during a war presents significant difficulties. There are complex criteria which have to be determined to assess whether a war crime has been committed. The death of a civilian or destruction of a residential building alone is not proof. Were there Ukrainian military present at the site or nearby? Was the intention to strike a civilian target or was it a mistake? Was it definitely a Russian shell that fell on this building? Obtaining accurate information about Ukrainian military movements can be difficult, because members of the public are often reluctant to say anything, even to prosecutors, about the locations of Ukrainian troops. The prosecutors try to check with the military, "but we cannot guarantee they will tell us the truth," said Oleksandr Filchakov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, "because there is a war on after all." Intentionality can be fiendishly difficult to prove, even with the best resources at your disposal. Satellite imagery can assist with determining where a rocket or artillery strike originated, but Ukrainian prosecutors have been unable to access it, because the priority is to use it for military purposes, because there is a war on. So all strikes on residential buildings and those that resulted in the deaths of civilians are all being recorded as alleged war crimes, under Article 438 of the Ukrainian criminal code. "To be a lawful strike it has to be on a military facility, military unit or some other military object," said Serhiy Shevtsov, a local prosecutor in the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv, as he examined an apartment building in his district that had been hit by a shell. "If it's a residential block, then it does not matter even if there were military in there until a few days before," he said, "it is Article 438."This is the prevailing view. But there is concern among some prosecutors and observers that the rush to investigate, while country is still at war, and to brand all these cases initially as war crimes, could undermine a broader future effort to hold Russia accountable. "It is absolutely fine to be talking about potential war crimes, but the moment you set things in stone you make it easier for the other side to discredit your work," said Philippe Sands, a UCL law professor who has served at the UN International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. "If you get to a court of law and you can't prove what you said happened, you have only created new problems," he said.One regional prosecutor concerned with the process is Denys Masliy, the deputy head of the criminal supervisory department, who said he feared there was a resistance setting in to characterising strikes against apparent civilian targets as anything other than a war crime. "Any prosecutor, any judge in Ukraine, in this environment, who would examine the details of Russian actions and rule they were lawful, he would look like a betrayer," Masliy said, standing under the ruins of a block of flats in central Kharkiv. "As a prosecutor, I must be honest, but this could be perceived as if I am not acting for Ukraine," he said.Masliy, a tall, good-humoured prosecutor with 24 years on the job, is something of a lone voice among his colleagues. "No one wants to talk about this, it is not a popular topic of conversation," he said. "But after this is all over, someone really impartial could take a deep look at all these cases and find problems. They will say we are fraudsters, our work is fake and we are the same as the Russians. The Russians will use it against us."Part of the problem stems from a genuine grey area around what constitutes a war crime. A week before the invasion, the regional prosecutors took an online training course on the issue. Masliy posed a scenario to the trainers from the prosecutor general's office: if he took his personal rifle and fired from his window at a Russian tank, and in response the Russians flattened his building, would it be a war crime? "One of the trainers said, you have a right to shoot because they are invaders," said Masliy. "The other guy said it could be considered a provocation, but he asked, is the danger from my rifle significant enough to justify blasting the whole block of flats? And they ended up having a quarrel with each other."Three months on from the training session, that hypothetical scenario has become a grim reality. Russia has flattened blocks of flats - with less provocation than a rifle shot - and much worse. The liberated suburbs west of Kyiv revealed execution-style killings and reports of brutal sexual violence. The horrors of Mariupol are yet to be fully discovered. "It looks clear that war crimes are being committed and it looks like they are widespread and systematic," said Sands, the UCL law professor. The chances of justice ever being served for those crimes, at the higher levels of the Russian army and political system, are remote. The key task now, said Sands, was to gather evidence in the most rigorous way possible. And the key challenge facing Ukraine's newly-minted regional war crimes prosecutors, and its politicians, he said, was to show caution and restraint."It is very difficult to show restraint in a time of war, and the people investigating are doing tremendous work, but I would urge real cool-headedness in the characterisation of what is being found and how it is being publicised," he said.The shelling of Vadym Bobryntsev's house in Mala Rohan, and the death of his wife, was recorded as a war crime, but expert analysis will have to be brought to bear on the case - on small shell fragments from the scene, the likely trajectory of the projectile, on troop movements in the area - before the truth can be established. When that expertise is available is an unknown - there is a severe shortage against the vast number of cases.When the shell hit the house, the village was occupied by the Russians, raising a question over whether the Russian army would have been shelling its own positions, two weeks into its occupation. This was the prosecutor's initial conclusion - Russian on Russian shelling - but it is possible Klymovets could have to contemplate reclassifying the case under a different legal statute if the evidence suggests it was a Ukrainian shell. "Of course, if we discover that this was done by our military, we will re-classify it," he said.To Vadym and Iryna Bobaryntsev's son, Pavlo, the important thing was to have "an objective investigation, objective truth," he said. "Truth must always prevail. This is a job that, although not very pleasant, helps to find the truth."In some cases, for some relatives, the objective truth could mean a verdict that the strike that killed their innocent loved one was lawful, under the rules of war. Pavlo stood alone by his father's vegetable patch, after his mother's casket had been loaded into the van, holding the picture of her he had found among the ruins of the house. "She gave life to me, helped me to solve many problems, treated me with understanding," he said. "How could this not be a crime?"© 2022 BBC.

m_text : But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  The These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Niño.For many years, groups of so-called climate "sceptics" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  A key UN report released in 2021 said it "is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".

m_text : Cameron Naughton said pig farmers were being put under pressure due to skilled labour shortages and rising costs."I fear for the welfare of the animals on the farm and I fear for the welfare of myself and my staff," he said.The government said it is providing temporary work visas and incentives to reduce backlogs at abattoirs. Mr Naughton, from Devizes, Wiltshire, said a shortage of skilled butchers arriving from Europe since Brexit, alongside large increases in the cost of fuel and wheat, had made the situation as bad as he had seen it in his 35 years in the industry. "We want the government to stop sacrificing the British pig industry on their political points and accept that there is a need to allow skilled workers to come into this country. "There is not the British workforce to do this job. Please let workers come from abroad," he said.Mr Naughton said the cost of production has increased rapidly over the past year and he was now "losing a substantial amount of money" on every pig he sold."Wheat is a major part of a pigs diet and that's gone up from £150 a tonne to over £300 a tonne. We have been losing about £5,000 a week since Christmas. "I've been carrying 500 extra pigs on the farm which would normally have been sold because there's been a huge issue with insufficient labour in pig processing plants," he said.Mr Naughton said he was "fed up and struggling to cope" and that some pig farmers in worse positions than he is are in a "very difficult place mentally".Dr Zoe Davies of the National Pig Association said the future of the UK pig industry was at risk unless the government steps-in to help."We've been asking the government for direct financial support for some time," she said."Other countries within the UK and Europe have been providing significant support packages for their producers and we would like our government to do the same. "We are already relatively small-scale and if we don't support those farmers remaining we will lose critical mass in the industry and end up importing all of the pork that we require." In a statement the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: "We have provided a package of measures to support the pig industry which includes temporary work visas for pork butchers, private storage aid and slaughter incentive payment schemes to help increase the number of pigs going through abattoirs."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : She always dreamt of becoming a mum. But there was a snag. Having her designs showcased at Paris Fashion Week - no problem. Finding a life partner - much more difficult. When she hit her mid-thirties, she started to worry."I just started reading a bunch of material online that says your body really becomes much less fertile after 35. I started freaking out," she says. She was single, so decided the time was right to freeze her eggs - a method of preserving fertility, so she could potentially try and have children at a later date. It's a relatively new process and success rates vary significantly, depending on how many eggs the woman freezes and her age at the time.A 2016 study of 1,171 in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles using frozen eggs, found for women who froze five eggs at age 35 or younger, the chance of a live birth was 15%. While this chance While, a When weighing up this data it is worth bearing in mind that the birth rate for IVF itself is low; just 24% per embryo transferred, according to the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. In spite of these odds, egg freezing may be growing in popularity, For example, in the US in 2017, 10,936 women froze their eggs - or 23 times as many did in 2009,but that already feels like old numbers. Singapore is the latest country to lift the ban on egg freezing for non-medical reasons - this will kick-in from January 2023.  In the UK, egg freezing is not normally covered by the NHS, unless you have a medical condition impacting your fertility, for example, certain cancers or lupus. Although the UK Government recently announced a 10-year limit on storing frozen eggs, sperm and embryos will be scrapped.There's no question the procedure is quite a financial undertaking. Carol spent almost $14,000 (£11,400) for one round of egg freezing and had to travel the US to do it. She didn't have as many eggs as she wanted, which she says made her feel "less of a woman." She is overjoyed for Singaporean women and hopes many more Asian countries will follow."Even in the US, as an Asian-American, it can be a taboo as a second-generation immigrant," she says, although adding she feels plummeting fertility rates may force the authorities' hands in some countries.In the end, Carol was lucky. She never needed to worry about paying for another round of egg freezing. Two years ago, she met her now husband and managed to conceive naturally in her 40s.In fact, the percentage of women who actually use their frozen eggs Another But that trend has not some stopped employers including it in an ever-expanding portfolio of fertility benefits.The trend started, unsurprisingly, in Silicon Valley in 2014, when Facebook and Apple began offering egg freezing to their employees as part of their benefits package. Fast forward eight years and big corporate firms are really struggling to recruit and retain workers, so various fertility benefits have gone from novelty to a must-have. Just under 40% of large companies in the US, so those over 500 employees, offer them.Even in Europe, with its much more generous, state-funded health services, some firms are starting to follow suit, Social media marketing firm, Hootsuite, for example.In the UK, companies like banking group, NatWest and energy firm, Centrica, offer up to £45 000 per employee for an appropriate treatment or service. Jenny Saft, is co-founder of a tech platform providing fertility benefits, working with employers across Europe. She says the picture is complex and there are many limitations and restrictions in accessing state-funded fertility treatments - so companies are increasingly stepping-in. In Germany, for example, health insurance covers half the costs for up to three IVF cycles, but only if you're married, in a heterosexual relationship and aged under 40 if you're a woman, she says. But not everyone thinks directly involving a company, or boss, in your fertility is good news. Dr Lucy Van De Wiel is a lecturer in Global Health and Social Medicine at King's College London. She calls these employment policies a "PR technology", that is successful at "attracting and retaining female staff, and that is how it is sold by the insurance companies to employers."Dr Van De Wiel is worried that the insurer gains a central role in how people approach their reproductive choices, which could lead to excessive commercialisation of fertility.She recognises that, on one hand, it's great that women get more information about their fertility, but her worry is that, this education could be coming from companies that stand to gain financially from people using those technologies. "It's very hard to avoid any kind of conflict of interest."This is a particular concern when it comes to egg freezing because, versus IVF, almost all women below a certain age could be treated as a potential client. Every woman who may want to have a child in the future could be a candidate for egg freezing. Dr Van De Wiel says there are studies showing women who are offered these services are quite happy to have options but also feel their employer may be telling them that they have to 'time' having children.New York-based entertainment lawyer, Nyasha Foy, is aware of the potential conflict of interest here. Her firm offered to pay for two rounds of egg freezing and storage, and she took up the benefit. "I absolutely do see this idea that if I give you $10,000 for the egg freezing, the return on the investment of you working one or two more years in this company, is a win," she says. "There's a sense of that kind of energy and you feel a little funny about it, right?"However, Ms Foy thinks women can change the dynamic and do it for themselves."I didn't meet my man in college, didn't meet my man in law school," she explains, "so there is this sense in the back of your head that you need to hurry up and just have a kid. I'm OK with the commodification of it, especially in America, as we're having to revisit Roe v Wade. To be able to say as a woman, I choose to just wait a little bit longer. That choice is not only body autonomy, that is life autonomy," she concludes.There is no denying that egg freezing is only gaining momentum in the developed world, and fertility clinics are fighting to attract customers by any means allowed. Fertility doctor, Aimee Eyvazzadeh, AKA the "egg whisperer", is based in California, and is known for throwing egg freezing parties in "swanky restaurants with beautiful bars and lovely food."She concedes it is a worry that freezing is talked about as a way of "taking control", or as an insurance policy. "You might have given yourself a future chance, but the chance may not have been as great as you had once thought," she adds.Dr Eyvazzadeh's average patient is 39 years old. She thinks that in 15 years that could rise to 49. Therefore, she believes young women, who have no fertility issues, should strongly consider freezing their eggs - "for their 40-year-old selves."Meanwhile, on the other side of the US, Nyasha Foy is considering her next steps. She hasn't yet used her frozen eggs and is still hoping to meet her "baby daddy" first, "I'm 37 now. If I get to a place where I can't carry a baby, I am in a position where I could potentially get a surrogate," she says. "I want to be a mother. I know that I'm going to get there. I don't know how or when, but I've done what I can do to give myself the best chance."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedMathew Benson has been rowing up and down one of the streets in a neighbourhood in the suburb of Australia's largest city. "I'm bringing food and water to people over there," he tells me, pointing to the other side. "We're just watching and waiting." While some cars are barely visible, others are completely submerged. Many residents in the area have had to leave their homes and others are stranded as roads have been cut off. Thousands have been left without power.Another local, Sam, points to her house just across the submerged road. "We don't know about the second floor. But the first floor is definitely flooded," she tells me in tears. This is the second time this has happened to her this year. Her house was damaged in the floods back in March. This time, she has had to move in with her mother who now also has to evacuate. It's all been too exhausting and emotional and she breaks down. "We just got back on our feet. We'd just cleaned up our house and fixed it up. And now this…" she said.Windsor is a close-knit community. Most of those I have spoken to have grown up in the area or have been here for at least two decades. Despite the fact that this is their third extreme flooding event in 18 months, many told me they wouldn't want to move.  But you can sense that everyone is exhausted. Not just from dealing with the current crisis, but from having to deal with one disastrous weather event after another. "Everybody is in shock. Everybody is traumatised," Linda Strickland tells me. She is the co-founder of local charity Hawkesbury's Helping Hands and has been helping people here for years, especially during natural disasters. I meet her on one of the streets in South Windsor where people have been stranded. Swathes of farmland now are completely covered in water."The community is still recovering from the last flood and the one before. Some people are still recovering from the fires," she said."Everyone is in disaster mode now. The most important thing is to make sure people are safe and have something to eat and know that someone cares."  Ms Strickland adds that while rebuilding will take a long time, her worry going forward is the mental and psychological toll this will take on the community."There needs to be someone counselling at every evacuation centre," she said. "I've never seen a flood like this in the 20 years I've lived here."   The wet weather has been relentless, with parts of Sydney getting eight months' worth of rain in four days. The newly-built Windsor bridge, which was supposed to be flood resistant, is hardly visible as the water continues to rise.Stuart Reed, 55, has lived in Windsor all his life and said this is unprecedented. "It just seems to be happening a lot more often," he said. "Apart from the trauma that this causes it's financially crippling as well. I just walked through town here and half the shops are shut."The New South Wales state Premier Dominic Perrottet has said it is time to let go of the idea that floods like this happen "once in a century" after some regions experienced their fourth deluge in less than two years. Sydney's main dam has been over-spilling through the night and the authorities have warned of more flood risks.  "It's crazy being told you have to leave your home and just grab what you can," Chloe Neich said. This is the first time she's had to evacuate. "A lot of stuff has been left behind and we don't really know what we're going back to. We're just hoping that our house is safe. And that we can get back to normal." I ask what normal is for her? "Not flooding," she smiles. "Kids out in the sun and park. Not worrying about whether they have a house." Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : The new structures exist for just a hundred thousandth of a billionth of a billionth of a second but may explain how our Universe is formed.Atoms contain smaller particles called neutrons and protons, which are made up of three quarks each."Exotic" matter discovered in recent years is made up of four and five quarks - tetraquarks and pentaquarks.Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland have discovered one new pentaquark and two tetraquarks. This takes the total number discovered there to 21. Each is unique, but researchers are excited about the qualities of the three new finds.The new pentaquark decays into particles that none of the others produce, while the two tetraquarks have the same mass, suggesting they may be the first known pair of exotic structures.Perhaps even more importantly, though, the latest finds mean that there are now enough of these particles to begin grouping them together, like the chemical elements in the periodic table. That is an essential first step towards creating a theory and set of rules governing exotic mass.In light of the new discoveries, physicists are discussing this very issue at a special seminar on Tuesday at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which houses the Large Hadron Collider.Working out minuscule differences between the tiniest things we know about may seem arcane, but the interaction of quarks creates the so-called "strong force" that holds the insides of atoms - and by extension our entire Universe - together."The strong force is extremely difficult to calculate, and we don't have firm predictions of how the exotic pentaquarks and tetraquarks are built," says Prof Chris Parkes of Manchester University. "But we hope that by finding out about them we can develop theories that enable us to understand them better."A Greek philosopher, Democritus, put forward the idea in the fifth century BC that the world was made up of indivisible particles which he called atoms. By the end of the 19th and early 20th century, experimental results showed that atoms were made up of smaller particles: electrons, neutrons and protons.  And in the 1960s, it became clear that neutrons and protons themselves were made from smaller particles still, called quarks; and that the interaction of quarks was tied to one of the fundamental forces of nature called the strong force. The force not only holds the insides of atoms together, but is important in the interactions of other sub-atomic particles that make the Universe tick.The Large Hadron Collider has undergone a major upgrade and the researchers involved believe that they will discover many more such exotic particles, some of which may have six quarks bound together.Some of these may have a less fleeting existence - perhaps a hundred billionth of a second. That is brief by human standards, but because these particles travel at close to the speed of light, they would leave trails a few millimetres long, which would be a treasured footprint for physicist sleuths to follow.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Now, the prime minister has lost the support of his MPs and is set to resign. How did it come to this?On Wednesday 29 June, the MP Chris Pincher - at the time, the Conservative deputy chief whip - went to a private members' club in London. In his words, he "drank far too much" He was accused of groping two men, which led to a flurry of allegations, some dating back years. It set off a chain of events that ended with the prime minister's downfall.First, Downing Street said Mr Johnson was not aware of "specific allegations" about Mr Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip in February. Ministers later reiterated this line - even though it turned out to be inaccurate.On 4 July, the BBC reported Mr Johnson had been aware of a formal complaint. The next day, a former civil servant - Lord McDonald - said the prime minister had been told of the complaint in person.Mr Johnson then admitted he had been told in 2019, and apologised for appointing Mr Pincher as deputy chief whip.This video can not be playedIn April this year, the prime minister was He also apologised for going to a "bring your own booze" party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown.More widely, the Metropolitan Police issued 126 fines to 83 people for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall.And a report by Sue Gray - a senior civil servant - described a series of social events by political staff that "The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture," she wrote.Last December, Mr Johnson told the Commons that "all guidance was followed completely in No 10". He is now being investigated by a Commons committee over Inflation has risen sharply in 2022, Many of the reasons were outside of Boris Johnson's control. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, has led to rises in oil prices and the cost of food.And, while the government has taken some steps - for example, by cutting fuel duty by 5p per litre - it also went ahead The government said the tax rise would pay for health and social care, and changes that kicked in this week "In the middle of the worst cost of living crisis for decades," said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in April, "the government chooses to increase taxes on working people".In October 2021, a House of Commons committee recommended a 30-day suspension for then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson. The committee said he broke lobbying rules, to try to benefit companies who paid him.But the Conservatives - led by the prime minister - After an outcry, This video can not be playedBoris Johnson won his thumping majority on the back of a clear, easy-to-follow policy - Get Brexit Done.But since then, his critics said, there was a lack of focus and ideas in Downing Street.His ex-adviser turned chief critic, Dominic Cummings, repeatedly accused him of being an out-of-control shopping trolley, veering from position to position.Others questioned the prime minister's philosophy - or, indeed, if he had one. In June, Conservative MP and former minister Jeremy Hunt accused Mr Johnson of lacking Mr Hunt was speaking before a confidence vote, which Mr Johnson won - but the complaints were getting louder.

m_text : Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told the BBC she was receiving reports of between 200 to 300 war crimes a day.She admitted that many trials would be held in absentia, but stressed that it was "a question of justice" to continue with the prosecutions.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. It denies all war crimes allegations.Speaking to the BBC's World Service Outside Source programme, Ms Venediktova warned that Russian soldiers who killed, tortured or raped civilians "should understand that it's only a question of time when they all will be in court".She said that although her team was working in regions across Ukraine, it was unable to investigate all cases "properly and effectively" because of a lack of access to some people and areas. This was an apparent reference to Ukraine's territories occupied by Russian troops.In May, Ms Venediktova said that about 600 suspects had already been identified and 80 prosecutions had begun.The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was Ukraine says it has uncovered multiple mass graves in Bucha, Borodyanka and other towns near the capital Kyiv that were briefly seized by Russian troops.The International Criminal Court has described Ukraine as a "crime scene", dispatching its largest team of detectives ever to the country to assist in multiple investigations.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. On the ground, Ukraine's military said Russian troops were preparing for an offensive in the eastern Donetsk region, shelling several towns.Russia captured nearly all of the neighbouring Luhansk region over the weekend, part of its attempts to seize the wider Donbas area.In its update, Ukraine's military said its forces were under intense pressure but had so far held off Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said "artillery from our Western partners had started working very powerfully, so the losses of the occupiers will only increase".This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Sterling traded at around $1.20as details emerged of a reshuffle to replace a stream of ministers who have resigned in the past 48 hours.Mr Johnson said the process of choosing a new Conservative Party leader "should begin now".XTB chief market analyst Walid Koudmani said it "will bring some relief to UK investors" and quell uncertainty.While the pound rose, it is still remains 4% lower than it was a month ago when it was trading at around $1.25.Mr Koudmani said: "Make no mistake the [pound] remains severely weak due to the dire state of the UK economy which is underperforming its peers, likely to enter into a recession while the Bank of England refuses to hike interest rates aggressively to deal with the escalating inflation."In his speech, Mr Johnson said: "I've agreed with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of our backbench MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week. And I've today appointed a cabinet to serve, as I will, until the new leader is in place."However, some Conservatives MPs have called for him to go sooner.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted: "We now need a new leader as soon as practicable. Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families."Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, the UK employers' group, said: "What business hates most is uncertainty and instability, which heightens the sense of external risk. Having said that, we recognise that this is an issue for the Conservative Party to resolve.

m_text : Lucy King couldn't wait to start her Speech and Language Therapy degree at Essex University last September. The first-year student has spina bifida and is paralysed below the knees and uses a wheelchair full-time. She also jokes about being a "female disabled lesbian who's also a feminist and Christian" and was worried about finding her community.Lucy isn't alone. UCAS - the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service - revealed to the It found 15% of disabled applicants share an LGBT identity, compared to 8% of non-disabled.The complexities of this go a lot further than just a paper exercise, it raises considerations about accessible venues, reasonable adjustments and inclusion.Lucy says moving to university was "very difficult". As well as all the usual administration and loan application she also had to arrange a care package for help with tasks including showering.But she says the hardest part was finding her disabled community."You need people to complain to, like when the lift is broken down. I found it very helpful to be able to have people who relate to me."With no Disabled Society, Lucy joined the LGBT society where she also found many disabled people - and says the UCAS figures ring true. But, she says, it would be so much better if ticking the "disabled" box on her UCAS form led to social connections as well as reasonable adjustments. This is something UCAS is hoping to address following its latest research, which revealed a record 83,220 disabled people applied last year - up from 77,000 in 2021CEO Clare Marchant says UCAS is "investing" in information to enable potential students to be able to talk to current students which she says will help people, like Lucy, find their communities more quickly.When Lucy did settle in she says societies and groups were all very accepting, but she faced discrimination in other ways.At an LGBT Christmas party she "did everything I could" to inform the host and nightclub that she used a wheelchair."But I turned up and you had to go up these very steep stairs. In the end, my dad carried me up the stairs," Lucy says.The event was held in a private room and "for no reason" there was a single step into it, meaning Lucy couldn't get to the bar although "I didn't let it stop me" having a good time. With London Pride taking place on Saturday and July being Disability Pride Month, Dr Ju Gosling, a disabled lesbian who is co-chair of Regard the LGBTQI+disabled peoples' organisation, says such incidents are a "real kick in the teeth".She's knows of another event for LGBT people of colour where organisers thought they had "ticked the intersectionality box". But it was at an upstairs venue with no accessible toilet and "completely inaccessible to disabled LGBT people of colour".She says incidents like this highlight how important it is to consider "people" rather than the minorities they might represent."It's not about having more than one identity, it's about having one unified identity and if people don't see all of those things about me, they don't know who I am."Dr Gosling says UCAS's figures reflect what she has seen in her own research although she believes the stats could be higher as many disabled people choose not to declare their sexuality in case it impacts on their care or support network.She says one of the reasons the number is higher than the general population is because discrimination can lead to disability or mental health problems due to the isolation and violence. She experienced a brain injury 20 years ago in a discriminatory attack.She also thinks long covid will change the picture again, which means adequate support and information is needed to ensure people don't face double discrimination - disability and sexual.Connor Scott-Gardner, a blind trans man studying at the University of Leeds, says he has experienced double discrimination at university.While his faculty has been "amazing", when he wanted to change his name he hit an administrative stumbling block.The university would only issue an inaccessible PDF form which he was unable to fill in because "I can't write or read". It took several stressful months before this was resolved.He says "toilets are another big one". If someone is unsure if Connor meant to enter the men's bathroom, instead of thinking it was his choice, they think "oh no, a blind person has gone in the wrong bathroom," and guide him out. "You have to laugh," he says, but it's a serious and personal matter.  Connor says recognising that people can belong to more than one group "goes a long way" and "means we plan better for everyone".Lucy, who has been appointed Disabled Student Officer, agrees. "Disability just needs to part of that conversation," she says. "Ensuring that events are held at accessible places."In the The presenters attempt blind tennis and disabled ballet dancer, Kate Stanforth, talks about teaching wheelchair-users how to tap dance...with their hands.Clare at UCAS says it is hoping to improve its own planning by connecting with disabled students long before they apply to ensure their needs are met and offer reassurances. She says some students start to think about university from the age of 10 and 56% of last year's disabled applicants specifically researched support before applying showing how "super important" it is.UCAS has called on the government to extend its Adjustment Passports to schools.Currently being trialled at the University of Wolverhampton and Manchester Metropolitan University the passports are a way to collate student information which can then be passed onto future employees without further assessments. "We know if a transition is a good transition than they're more likely to continue in their studies and be successful," Clare says, while the government adds it is "considering its next steps". Although some people may not want to disclose their disability to UCAS, Clare says it opens up lots of support options."It's not just about access arrangements once you get to university. Think about open days and interviews and auditions - universities can help with that." Dr Ju agrees planning is important, but says it's also about thinking more deeply about the people around you, especially if they require some level of care."I've come across situations where everybody thinks so-and-so is unsociable, but they're not. They just have to be back in their room at 20:00 because they're put into bed by 21:00 and they might not want to disclose that."She says for visually impaired students it might be a case of knocking on their door to "offer an elbow" to guide them to a function."Don't just assume, ask people what they need to take part."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and "well below" 2C.China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are "highly insufficient".  Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.President Xi says China will "phase down" coal use from 2026 - and will Researchers at And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas."China is already leading the global energy transition," says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. "One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China." China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.Here again, there is encouraging news. China is It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. The world needs China to succeed. "Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change," says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task.

m_text : "This is a story that comes around every time a tank gets knocked out," says David Willey, curator and instructor at the Tank Museum at Bovington, Dorset, which boasts the world's largest collection of tanks. "Because the tank is such a symbol of power, when it's defeated people jump to the conclusion it's the end of the tank."We are watching a Soviet-designed T72 main battle tank rev its engines and clatter towards the refuelling point before rehearsing for a demonstration. This is basically the same tank model that rolled across the border into Ukraine in February and destroyed in their hundreds by small, agile bands of well-trained Ukrainian infantry wielding drones, Javelin and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons (Nlaws). "It's important not to draw the wrong lessons from what we have witnessed over the past several months," says retired US Army Lt Gen Ben Hodges, who until recently commanded US land forces in Europe.  "The Russian tanks in question were typically poorly employed, unsupported by dismounted infantry, and without the benefit of a strong non-commissioned officer (NCO) corps, such as one finds in the US Army or British Army. Therefore, they were all easy kills for the defending Ukrainian forces."His views are echoed by retired British Army Brigadier Ben Barry, now senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. "The defeat of the Russian attack on Kyiv shows what happens when tanks are inexpertly deployed by a force that cannot do combined arms warfare (combining tanks with infantry, artillery and aircraft) and has weak logistics. "A competent Nato battle group would push out infantry to stop tanks being ambushed."The tank - one of the iconic symbols of modern warfare - has both its critics and defenders. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Armenia's tanks got decimated by Azerbaijan's Turkish-made drones. In Libya, these same drones, the TB2 Bayraktar, inflicted serious losses on the forces of General Haftar, while in Syria, government tanks also fell prey to the Turkish drones. In the early phase of the Ukraine war, modern anti-tank guided missiles, supplied by Britain, the US and other nations, proved to be a game-changer in driving back the Russian armoured columns from north of the capital, Kyiv. Meanwhile, in the second phase, in the Donbas, massed Russian artillery has been the game-changer, using destructive firepower to slowly blast its way forward.So far this year, Russia is estimated to have lost more than 700 tanks - some destroyed, some abandoned. These tanks are often pictured covered in reactive armour - which looks like a large rectangular box. It is designed to set off a small explosion as the missile hits, blunting its effect. But Western-supplied drones and anti-tank missiles have got around this, mainly by hitting the tank from above on the turret, where the armour is thinnest."This war has been the day of the drone," says Brig Barry. "It tells us that you need drones for defence to keep enemy drones off your back. You need classic low-level air defence including lasers and electronic jamming."Something that may prolong the future of the tank is the Active Protection System (APS). It is a way to head off whatever is attacking your tank before it hits you. "There are two types of APS, soft and hard kill evasion suites," explains Bovington's David Willey. He pauses while the nearby T72 tank, a gift from the Polish Army, belches blue exhaust fumes and swivels its massive 125mm gun menacingly in our direction. "Soft kill means electronic pulses that can disrupt the incoming missile. Hard kill means firing something kinetic at it, like a stream of bullets." As is so often the case, the Israeli military have researched this area exhaustively, especially since 2006 when their tanks took a beating from Hezbollah's IED's and skilfully deployed anti-tank missiles in south Lebanon. They developed an Active Protection System called Trophy. It works by using radar to track the incoming threat - missile or drone - then a rotating launcher on the turret fires a stream of explosive projectiles, neutralising it before it can hit the tank. Trophy, or a variant of it, is likely to become standard on many of the latest Western tanks."Advances in counter-drone measures will reduce the effectiveness of drones that now seem to roam about the battlefield looking for easy targets," says Gen Hodges.So, does the tank have a future? Or is it, as some predict, doomed for the scrapyard?"There will always be a need for protected mobile firepower," says Gen Hodges. He predicts a future, not far off, where remote-controlled, unmanned tanks - essentially armoured drones - will be moving across the battlefield in tandem with crewed tanks, increasing their firepower while reducing the risk to life. "I was an Infantry soldier and I'd never want to be in any fight in any terrain without the benefit of protected, mobile firepower," he says.Justin Crump, a former British Army tank commander and now CEO of the defence intelligence firm Sibylline, agrees. "Tanks have a firepower, mobility and resilience that Infantry just don't have. It's a flexible platform that can operate day and night, get to the objective and deliver shock to the enemy. Ukraine would not be rebuilding its tank forces if tanks were not vital. They have asked for over twice the number of tanks that the UK possesses." David Willey has been instructing the British Army and more recently, visiting Ukrainian soldiers. "It's not the best tank that counts, it's the best crew," he says. "The most expensive kit in the world doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win. Belief in your cause is vital, and the Ukrainians believe in their cause."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Cherelle Grinner told a rally organised by her wife's team, Phoenix Mercury, that she feared she is not going to get justice from Russian officials. Brittney Griner has been held in Moscow for over four months on drug charges. The call comes as Russian authorities urged US officials not to create publicity around the case."The hype and working on the public, with all the love for this genre among modern politicians, currently only disturbs" the court process, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. "It does not just distract from the case but creates interference," he added. "Silence is needed here."Grinner, 31, was detained at Sheremetyevo airport, outside Moscow, on 17 February when a search of her luggage allegedly revealed cannabis oil vape cartridges. She is due to appear in court later on Thursday.  She could face up to 10 year in prison if found guilty.The two-time Olympic gold medallist sent President Biden a letter this week, telling him she was "terrified (she) might be here forever".Cherelle Griner expressed anger at the slow pace of her wife's case. "What and how I feel today is a deeper emotion than hurt. I'm frustrated," she said. "I'm frustrated that 140 days have passed since my wife has been able to speak to me, to our family and to our friends. I'm frustrated that my wife is not going to get justice," she added."Let's make sure this administration knows that they have our support to do whatever is necessary, and that we are not going to ever be quiet until she's home safely."Grinner, one of the WNMA's most successful players, travelled to Russia to play club basketball during the US off-season, a common move for US players seeking to top-up their salary. She has played with the EuroLeague team UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia since 2014.US authorities were initially slow to draw attention to the case - which occurred just five days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine - but have since upped the ante. On Wednesday, Mr Biden told Cherelle Griner that he was working to secure Brittney's release as soon as possible. Fewer than 1% of defendants in criminal cases are acquitted in Russia.However unlike in US courts, even if she is acquitted, Russia's government has the authority to overturn any decision and send her to prison.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The powers will be introduced through an amendment to the Online Safety Bill, which aims to police the internet.If the tech firms do not comply, Ofcom will be able to impose fines of up to £18m or 10% of the company's global annual turnover, whichever is higher.However there is growing concern over how it will work in practice.There are questions over what exactly the extra tools are that media regulator Ofcom will get.And one of the main concerns surrounds the popular The government says it is supporting the development of tools which could detect child sexual abuse imagery content within or around an E2EE environment, while respecting user privacy. It says this will further inform the wider debate around user privacy and user safety.But Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey told the BBC that to detect child abuse imagery or associated text, the current techniques will only work on unencrypted data. "If the OSB insists on discovering such material in encrypted data, it can be achieved only by examining the sending and receiving devices, i.e. where it is decrypted for consumption."The implication is some form of universal 'client-side scanning' which many will see as overly intrusive and liable to... be used to detect other items unrelated to child safety."Client-side scanning refers to technology that scan message contents for matches against a database of content (for example child sexual abuse images) before the message is sent to the intended recipient.If Ofcom gets the powers to impose scanning technologies, there are calls from experts for the government to flesh out the detail on the technical feasibility, security implications and impact on privacy. "The big issue will be that any technology that can be used to look at what is otherwise encrypted could be misused by bad actors to conduct surveillance," Prof Woodward said.One of the fundamental premises of E2EE is that only the sender and intended recipients of a message can know or infer the contents of that message. It is one of the reasons that people like using WhatsApp and Signal.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the charity the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), wants provisions in the OSB to enable Ofcom to co-designate with the IWF to regulate child sexual abuse material online.She said: "Our unparalleled expertise in this area would make the response strong and effective from day one. "We have the strong collaborative relationships with industry, law enforcement, as well as the world-leading expertise which can make sure no child is left behind or their suffering left undetected."The Government says it will not be enough for a big tech company to say it simply cannot deploy certain technologies on its platform, because of they way it is configured.If it is proportionate and necessary, Ofcom can now issue a notice to a company to take steps to demonstrate they are using their best endeavours to develop or source tools which will remove child sexual abuse imagery. But this all depends on the regulator's assessment of the risk of child exploitation.Prof Woodward said: "Ofcom have a steep hill to climb. They will need to attract a lot of rare talent...to come up with the technical solutions demanded by the OSB. "That's not to mention the skills they will need to navigate the secondary legislation...It's a truly huge task ahead of them."Ofcom told the BBC it was preparing to take on the new role, bringing in skills and expertise from across the tech sector, as well as experts from child protection and advocacy bodies.Its spokesperson said: "Tackling child sexual abuse online is central to the new online safety laws - and rightly so. It's a big and challenging job, but we'll be ready to put these ground-breaking laws into practice once the OSB is passed."The National Crime Agency estimates there are between 550,000 and 850,000 people in the UK who pose a sexual risk to children. Access to such content online can lead to offenders normalising their own consumption of this content, sharing methods with each other on how to evade detection, and escalation to committing actual child sexual abuse offences.Digital minister Nadine Dorries said: "Tech firms have a responsibility not to provide safe spaces for horrendous images of child abuse to be shared online. Nor should they blind themselves to these awful crimes happening on their sites."Maeve Hanna, partner at law firm Allen & Overy told the BBC: "While the objectives of the amendment are laudable, it's not clear what a tech company will have to do in practice to comply with notices issued by Ofcom or to avoid the large fines threatened. "This lack of clarity will also present real challenges to any Ofcom enforcement action. For example, how will Ofcom show that tech companies could have - but failed to - develop any particular new technology where that technology doesn't exist yet?"How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Multiple people say they are being forced to quarantine, blocked from public transport or entering buildings.Most appear to be customers of four rural banks which had run into issues providing cash withdrawals, report Chinese media outlets.The banks froze deposits, prompting angry demonstrations last month.China's banking and insurance regulator has since ordered an investigation into the banks. More than 39 billion yuan (£5bn; $6bn) is believed to have been frozen, affecting hundreds of thousands of customers.In many Chinese cities, residents use a "health code" app to enter buildings and shops, use public transport, or leave the city. Users must scan a QR code and show a colour-coded "health status" on their phone before entering. If this status turns red, it indicates the person has tested positive for Covid recently or is suspected to have Covid, and must be quarantined for 14 days.On Tuesday, some residents found their status had turned red when they tried to enter train stations, buildings, or hotels. It is not known how many have been affected, but Chinese reports indicate that the issue has occurred in several towns and villages in Henan. Customers of the four banks who travelled from other provinces to Henan's capital city Zhengzhou have also encountered the same issue.One bank customer in Zhengzhou told BBC Chinese her status was red even though she had never been in contact with a confirmed case, and her most recent tests showed she was negative.She added that she was visited by health officials who asked her to stay at home and refused to explain why her status had suddenly turned red. Some of those affected appear to be relatives of customers. One woman who lives in Zhumadian, a town 200km (124 miles) from Zhengzhou, said she was taken to a hotel for mandatory quarantine once her status turned red. "I am not a customer, it's my dad who deposited money in one of the banks and now he can't get it out," she told BBC Chinese."He recently went to Zhengzhou to understand the situation. Once he came back, his health status turned red. My whole family is now in quarantine after our statuses turned red."A staff member at the Zhengzhou health commission confirmed with BBC Chinese that many of the banks' customers had run into the same problem."There is such a situation. At the moment, they can only contact their community managers to apply (to change their status). After they do two Covid tests within three days, their status can be changed back," the staff member said.The move has raised questions on Chinese social media where many have pointed out that this was a possible abuse of power by officials.Popular Chinese commentator and former newspaper editor Hu Xijin said that "health codes" should "only be used purely for pandemic prevention purposes"."If any area uses health codes to restrict people's movements for other purposes, this is clearly a breach of pandemic prevention laws... and damages the support of the people for our fight against the virus," he said.In April, the New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, and Yuzhou Xin Min Sheng Village Bank froze their customers' deposits.Since then, thousands of customers have been travelling to Zhengzhou to attempt to withdraw their money. Small protests have erupted, culminating in a large demonstration on 23 May where thousands took to the streets, before police shut it down.The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said last month that the major shareholder of the village banks, a company called Henan New Fortune, used third-party platforms or a money broker to take public funds. The company is suspected of financial crimes and authorities are currently investigating.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Some of this is because of theBut his music is also continuing to make waves.In June, Moose Wala's last song SYL was removed from YouTube in India after the government lodged a legal complaint. The posthumously released song talks about decades-long dispute over sharing river water between Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana, while also touching upon some other controversial subjects like Sikh militancy. It's fitting that his legacy of asking hard questions continues even after his death.In a career spanning just four years, Moose Wala wrote several powerful lyrics that explored the history and current state of Punjab. Critics say the state has an unsavoury side, involving a gritty gangster culture, corruption and rising unemployment and his music spotlighted that.His fans see him as a man who was engaged with social realities. But what set him apart from his contemporaries was that he also offered a divergent vision of how Punjabis perceive themselves and his ideas were often considered unsettling and incendiary. His affinity for guns and attempt to force listeners into complex and sometimes even uncomfortable conversations - like SYL - made him the subject of intense scrutiny."There is no doubt that he was a man of contradictions," says Harinder Happy, a research scholar who has studied Punjab closely. "But his style spoke to the times and to living in a post-modernist society where everyone has the right to assert their identity the way they understand it." Moose Wala was also deeply rooted to his home and village in a state where thousands are looking to immigrate to foreign shores in search of a better life. "He was many things, but above all he was deeply connected with the ecology of his village," says Pritam Singh, professor of economics at Oxford Brookes University, who has followed Moose Wala's music closely.The singer was born as Shubhdeep Sidhu in a upper-caste Jatt-Sikh family. After studying engineering, he moved to Canada, where hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have emigrated.It was there that he began his music career, releasing his debut album PBX 1 in October 2018 under the stage name of Sidhu Moose Wala  - or "Sidhu of Moosa", his village.The singer maintained a distinct hip-hop vocabulary, from clothes to style, which made him an instant hit on the global stage. His music at the time was also typically macho - as rap music often is - and swaggered on the edge of violence. Unapologetically belligerent, he sang about his fondness for guns, boasted about his caste and gave details of a put-down of his enemies."Moose Wala could've lived anywhere he wanted. But he chose his village, his parents and his people," Mr Happy says. "He not just held on to his village identity but also sought to elevate it, despite its complexities."Mansa district, where Moose Wala's village is located, is widely seen as a backward region - it has one of the highest farmer suicide rates in Punjab and high unemployment levels and a serious groundwater crisis."People don't want to be identified with the region - they want to leave and never come back," Mr Happy explains. "But Moose Wala was different. He took pride in his roots and his music urged listeners to proudly accept the village as home."This is captured most powerfully in Tibeyan Da Putt (Son of the sand dunes), signifying the semi-arid landscape of the region. "We do not belong to noble families/ Brought-up in the village and townships/ I don't have any existence of my own/ Yet, influential people fear me," the lyrics say.Song after song, Moose Wala evoked the pull of village life, urging his listeners to embrace an agrarian lifestyle. In Bambiha Boley, he highlighted the beauty of traditional folk music; in Never Fold, he turned to stories of Robin Hood-like folk heroes who robbed the rich to help the poor.Mr Happy says that Moose Wala came to embody the aspirations of the entire region, helping people cope and take pride in their identity."And he was accessible - anyone could meet him and he loved his fans. The singer often shot most of his videos in his village, featuring his family, which made him even more relatable," he adds.Over time, Moose Wala's music also became more socially, culturally and politically conscious.The most iconic of these was 295 - a song about freedom of speech in India. The title refers to Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code, which penalises actions "intended to outrage religious feelings".In 2020, his song on India's contentious agricultural laws became an anthem for protesting farmers. The lyrics - "This is none other than the Punjab, which takes revenge with an open challenge" - were hailed for embodying the power of resistance, but critics said they were problematic and glorified violence. Moose Wala never really stopped being controversial - he continued to sneer at his enemies and pose with guns. "But over time, he moved away from casteist metaphors and his engagement with weapons became more measured," Prof Singh says.This thematic shift, he adds, is central to the singer's personality. "That's because Moose Wala's story is also one of personal evolution. And unless we understand that, we cannot understand why he was so popular."The contradictions don't end there.Both Prof Singh and Mr Harry point out that unlike other rappers, Moose Wala's music lacked the sexual explicitness often associated with hip-hop and especially rap and his music never objectified or denigrated women.In Dear Maa - a song dedicated to his mother - Moose Wala does not eschew overt sentimentality. Rather, he embraces it, Prof Singh says."It is remarkable that a man who is accused of being masochistic and violent is actually saying 'mother, I am like you'. And he captures the nuances so beautifully - one moment he says he's hot as the sun but other times he is soft like her."In his memoir, popular American rapper JayZ wrote: "Rap is built to handle contradictions." And Moose Wala's music almost always carried multiple meanings, from political leanings to the messiness of identity and questions that often defy simple explanations.Mr Happy says that music was Moose Wala's way to hold difficult conversations, to talk back and to assert his identity."His music's most persistent subject has been what it means to be Punjabi and how identity cannot be a monolith. Every album, every song, and every word is dedicated to demonstrating this truth," he adds.This inquiry into the Punjabi identity was also rooted in his insistence that life in Punjab was more than just violence and drugs. By blending folk music with slick beats and sounds, Moose Wala was able to create rhymes that addressed the lives of Punjabis in ways they understood."It was this rural rootedness of his which resonated with people so deeply," Prof Singh says.More than anything, Moose Wala, Mr Happy says, put forth an exciting idea that there was freedom to be found within music."And being controversial is inevitable when you ask tough questions."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The huge plant had been in the archives of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and was growing in a number of aquatic collections but it was mistakenly identified as another species.Now a detailed scientific study has revealed that it is new to science.It also holds the record as the world's largest water lily, with leaves growing more than 3m (10ft) wide.The plant has been called This video can not be playedHorticulturist Carlos Magdalena, one of the world’s leading water lily experts, long suspected that the plant was different from the other two known giant species,So scientists from Bolivia - from the National Herbarium of Bolivia, Santa Cruz Botanic Gardens and Public Botanic Garden La Rinconada - donated some seeds to Kew.He told BBC News: “It meant we could grow it side-by-side with the two other species under exactly the same conditions. Once we did this we could very clearly see that every single part of the plant was totally different.”He described the find as the “highlight” of his career. Working alongside Carlos, botanical illustrator Lucy Smith made detailed scientific drawings of all three species.This also involved heading into the glasshouse at night because water lily flowers only come out in the dark. She said: “I was able to get access to the flowers, and also by looking at the leaves, I could, as an illustrator, highlight those differences that I saw. “And in fact, while I was drawing those differences, they became even stronger in my mind and I found new ways of telling them apart.”She added: “Maybe I’m biased, but out of the three species I think [the new species] has one of the most beautiful flowers.”Kew has a long history with the plants - the Waterlily House was built in 1852 to showcase its collections. The giants - discovered in the 1800s -  were a natural wonder of the age, and the genus was named after Queen Victoria.But the new discovery shows that water lilies still have some surprises, and scientists say there is still much to learn about them.Dr Alex Monro, from RBG Kew, explained: ”None of the three species have been very well studied. “We still don't know how many populations there are and how much they vary in size. We don't really understand the pollination biology very well. We don't know a lot about the dispersal of the species - how it transmits itself from one place to another. “So there are still many unknowns. And I think, because they're so huge - so obvious - people haven't really thought to study them in that much detail.”The description of the plant is published in the Follow Rebecca How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Citizens were urged to be vigilant around objects that may have blown across the border from the South.For years activists in the South have flown balloons across the border to send leaflets and humanitarian aid.In response, Seoul says there is "no possibility" Covid could have crossed the border in that way. According to North Korea's state media, an official investigation found two people who became infected with Covid early on in the outbreak after coming into contact with unidentified materials near the South Korean border.An 18-year-old soldier and five-year-old child tested positive for the virus in early April after finding the objects on a hill in Ipho-ri, it reported.Since then, state media said: "The malignant Covid-19 virus...has rapidly spread in the DPRK [North Korea]."As a result of the investigation, people in the country are instructed to "vigilantly deal with alien things coming by wind and other climate phenomena and balloons in the areas along the demarcation line and borders." Anyone who notices a strange object is instructed to report it immediately so it can be swiftly removed by an emergency anti-epidemic team.Although the report did not mention South Korea directly, Seoul's unification ministry strongly denied the North's explanation for how Covid could have got into the country. The closed border between the Koreas is one of the most heavily guarded in the world, but defectors and South Korean activists have for years launched balloons across the divide with anti-North Korean messages. Since late April North Korea has been battling an explosive wave of 4.7 million cases of "fever," believed to be untested Covid infections.Kim Jong-un described the outbreak in May as the greatest "turmoil to fall on our country since the founding", state media reported.Until this year the reclusive nation had claimed to be completely Covid-free - although some experts believe the virus may have been circulating before then.Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare system, although in recent weeks there have been media reports that Pyongyang has accepted an offer of Chinese-manufactured vaccines. It's not clear how many North Koreans, if any, have so far been vaccinated.In the last few weeks officials say the number of new cases has dropped dramatically but many suspect the government of under-reporting the true figures.The outbreak began some months after the North eased a strict lockdown of its border with China - with freight trains resuming their journeys between the two countries for the first time since early 2020.Any suggestion that the virus could have entered the country this way, especially as China was dealing with a severe outbreak of the Omicron variant, would have raised difficult and diplomatically sensitive questions, North Korea expert Professor Lim Eul-chul told Reuters news agency."If they concluded the virus was from China they would have had to tighten quarantine measures on the border area in a further setback to North Korea-China trade," he said.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Scandals that would have sunk other politicians appeared to have no effect on him. He was always able to bounce back. His gaffes and blunders became part of his brand. In an age of boring, machine-like politicians, he was seen as a "character", his unruly mop of blond hair and bumbling persona instantly recognisable even to those with no interest in politics. His fun-loving, relentlessly upbeat image, allied to formidable campaigning skills, helped him reach parts of the electorate more conventional Conservatives could not.He won two terms as mayor of London, normally a Labour stronghold, and helped convince millions to back Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum.He became prime minister in July 2019 without an election - but four months later secured an historic landslide victory, winning seats in parts of the country that had never voted Conservative before. As 2020 dawned, his dominance of British politics appeared to be complete. But then came coronavirus.A global pandemic would have tested any leader and Johnson's government made its share of mistakes, with the UK at one point having the highest death rate in the developed world.But, in the end, it was not his handling of coronavirus that led to his downfall. It was, rather, questions about his character and fitness for high office.To some long-time observers of Johnson's career, this did not come as a surprise. In From his earliest days, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson had a tendency to believe rules were for other people. "Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility," his teacher Martin Hammond wrote of the 17-year-old Boris. "I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else."His unwavering self-belief, however, left an impression."Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating," Simon Veksner, a school friend, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums.He won a scholarship to Eton, arguably England's most prestigious private school, where he discovered a love of Classics and began developing the persona that would become so familiar in his later life.Oxford University followed, where he achieved his ambition of becoming president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823, and the time-honoured training ground for Conservative politicians. He also joined the infamous Bullingdon Club, known for the rowdy, drunken behaviour of its members, which included future prime minister David Cameron.He left Oxford and was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but lost his job after falsifying a quote - an incident he would later describe as his "biggest cock-up". It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given work by then-editor of the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings.As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson set about ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. It was, Disaster loomed again, however, when a recording surfaced of a telephone call between Johnson and his old Oxford friend, Darius Guppy, who had been demanding the private address of a News of the World journalist.The tape suggested Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though Guppy, who was later jailed for fraud, had indicated he had wanted to have the reporter, who had been investigating his affairs, beaten up.Hastings confronted him about the recording, which had been sent anonymously to the Telegraph, but after an apology, with Johnson deploying, in Hastings' words, "all of his self-parodying skills as a waffler", he was sent back to Brussels with a rebuke.In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament.With the Tories languishing in opposition, then-leader Michael Howard was keen to harness the star power of the new MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.But Mr Johnson's career as a frontbencher was short-lived.In 2004, Mr Howard ordered him to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city over a Spectator article that had attributed some of the blame for the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of the city's football fans. He survived "Operation Scouse Grovel", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.Within a year he was back on the frontbench, under new Tory leader David Cameron. But he was increasingly seen as comedian and TV personality, rather than a serious candidate for power.He had to wait until 2007 to get a chance to move up the ladder, when a somewhat trepidatious Cameron selected him as the Conservative candidate for London mayor. Johnson surprised everybody by storming to victory over Labour's Ken Livingstone, who had looked unbeatable, and winning again four years later. As mayor, Mr Johnson scrapped the unpopular "bendy buses", implemented a bike hire scheme (colloquially known to Londoners as "Boris bikes") and oversaw arrangements for the 2012 London Olympics - leading to one of the more infamous images of his political career, as he dangled from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags.In early 2016, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a "career psychopath".Johnson deployed all of his formidable campaigning skills, although he came in for heavy criticism for the claim - printed on the side of a battlebus - that the UK sent the EU £350m a week, which did not take into account the UK's rebate.When his side emerged victorious, it was inevitable that Mr Johnson would throw his hat into the ring to replace the outgoing David Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. It was a brutal political assassination, met with dismay by Johnson's supporters.Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.His opponents had a field day trawling the archives for past gaffes and indiscretions, which included a 2007 newspaper column describing then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as looking like a "sadistic nurse in a mental hospital". He had also been forced to say sorry to Papua New Guinea over a reference to "orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing" and, going further back, had apologised for using an racial slur when writing about the Queen's tours of Commonwealth countries.During his tenure at the Foreign Office, Johnson supported a tough line against Russia and expelled 23 diplomats following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal. He also attracted criticism when he mistakenly said Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the aid worker imprisoned in Iran, had been working as a journalist.In 2018, he quit the cabinet in protest at Theresa May's Brexit deal, arguing it would lead Britain into "the status of a colony". He returned to his former highly paid job as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, immediately running into controversy and accusations of Islamophobia after writing that Muslim women wearing burkas "look like letter boxes".He remained a stern critic of May from the backbenches and, when she was forced to resign, he once again ran to be leader of his party. This time he was successful, building a commanding lead, not only with Conservative party members - with whom he had always been popular - but, critically, with Tory MPs.His first few months in the role proved to be rocky as he struggled to govern with his party's at first tiny, then non-existent majority in the House of Commons.He recruited Dominic Cummings - regarded with suspicion and seen as a troublemaker by many Conservatives - as his closest Downing Street aide. At Cummings' behest, he fought a guerrilla war against those MPs seeking to block his Brexit strategy, including some high-profile members of his own party.In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to "Get Brexit Done", a slogan dreamed up by Cummings.The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.In a dramatic televised statement, he announced a national lockdown, a move unprecedented in peace time. The self-proclaimed libertarian and champion of the free market was now ordering the nation to stay in their homes, shutting down of huge of swathes of the UK economy and promising to spend billions on subsidising the wages of furloughed workers.In April 2020, Johnson tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted "it could have gone either way".Less than three weeks later, his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth to their first child, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson - Nicholas in a tribute to the doctors who had treated him in hospital.The twice-divorced prime minister married Ms Symonds at Westminster Cathedral at the end of May 2020. Their daughter Romy was born in December 2021. Ms Symonds was a well-connected figure behind the scenes in the Conservative Party and her influence came to be resented by Mr Cummings and his close-knit team of former Vote Leave officials, who were now at the heart of the Downing Street machine.As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world, helping the UK economy to re-open earlier than most. The mass unemployment predicted by many had also been avoided. But his political problems were beginning to mount up.Back in May 2020, he had stood by Dominic Cummings when he came under fire over a lockdown-busting trip to County Durham. But Mr Cummings was forced out of Downing Street at the end of that year after losing a power struggle with Carrie Symonds, and now appeared determined to remove him from office. In an explosive appearance before a select committee, Mr Cummings said Mr Johnson was "unfit for the job" of prime minister, and that thousands of people had died needlessly because he had delayed lockdowns and ignored scientific advice.Johnson was also under investigation over an expensive designer revamp of the Downing Street flat where he lived with his family, which was initially paid for by a Conservative donor. He was ultimately cleared by his ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, but the peer later rebuked his boss for having "insufficient" respect for his role, after new information came to light that had not been revealed to his inquiry. Lord Geidt would later quit the role in exasperation at the prime minister's attitude to ministerial standards.Mr Johnson's political opponents, who had been unable to lay a glove on him at the height of the pandemic, were now making hay with accusations of sleaze and cronyism, and a prime minister with an apparently cavalier disregard for long-established rules of behaviour. This impression was not helped by Johnson's attempt to rewrite the disciplinary code for MPs to help his ally Owen Paterson, who was facing suspension for breaking lobbying rules. Johnson later confessed this had been a "total mistake".But worse was to come in November 2021, when the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police over lockdown parties, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.He faced an investigation by a Commons committee into whether he had misled Parliament with his initial claims that there had been no parties in Downing Street. The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. Booing was heard when Johnson and his wife arrived for the Platinum Jubilee thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral.He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite 41% of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to "get on with the job" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.The rollercoaster career of a politician who had defied political gravity for nearly four decades has finally come crashing to earth.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The latest statistics show the number of people infected in the UK has So is summer ruined? Two-and-a-half years into the pandemic we're back facing new variants, a surge in infections, questions about whether the NHS can cope and what it means for all our lives. It's also giving us a clearer idea of what living with Covid is going to look like. "We're in a bad patch at the moment," says professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld. "It's very disruptive to society and some are suffering severe effects, but that's still a tiny proportion of where we were."The driving force behind the sudden surge in infections is the double act of BA.4 and BA.5. These two mutated forms of the virus are technically sub-variants of Omicron. The original Omicron had an impressive ability to spread and overcome the immune defences our bodies have built up to keep the virus out. BA.4 and BA.5 are even better. Their ascent started before big summer events like the Jubilee celebrations or Glastonbury so it's not like we've just partied our way into a new wave.Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, says it's "shocking" how much the virus is able to change to keep on infecting us. He recalls seeing the first scientific analysis of Omicron last winter: "I felt like I'd just seen the worst horror film on the planet and yet it keeps throwing up worse ones". The result is we're now entering another - arguably our third - Omicron wave of the year and it's only just July. Research in the The new sub-variants' slippery skills combined with our waning immunity means stories of catching Covid multiple times are now increasingly common. Plus there's still a surprising number - "[This virus] continues to surprise us in unpleasant ways, you would have hoped there would be more protection from one Omicron variant to another" says Prof Mark Woolhouse, who studies disease outbreaks at the University of Edinburgh. However, the most important form of protection - against becoming severely ill, ending up in hospital and dying - is clearly holding up. If there were 2.3 million cases in the era before vaccines then the NHS would be swamped and tens of thousands of people would die. That is clearly not happening. But even with that protection BA.4 and BA.5 still have the potential to leave you feeling seriously rough."I think it's far from a bad cold," says Prof Susan Hopkins, from the UK Health Security Agency, who says people are "ill for between seven and 10 days". That has knock-on effects if you need to work - staff sickness in the NHS is another way the virus can pile pressure on the health service - or were planning to go on a nice holiday. "What do you do if your school has no teachers or an airline has no pilots? How do you suck that up?" asks Prof Altmann.Rising cases will also have a disproportionate effect on There are no signs this virus is any more or less dangerous that original Omicron, but we don't know for sure. So far there is only laboratory and animal research. The UKHSA Prof Woolhouse, who was one of the scientists to However, variants don't have to be worse for it to impact the NHS - they just have to infect enough people. Then the small proportion who do get into trouble still add up to a big number.The number of people in hospital with Covid across the UK is 10,081 - up by around 2,500 in a week. More than half of those will be there for other reasons, such as a broken bone or a stroke, but they still need to be managed. "I remain concerned, one more doubling [in numbers] brings the NHS into significant challenge," says Prof Hopkins, the chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency.The hope will be that the UK follows a similar trajectory to countries like South Africa and also Portugal.Prof Bauld: "I think we should be optimistic, in those countries that are ahead of us, things are settling down, these things do burn themselves out as they run out of people to infect." However, it looks as though the idea that Covid will just become a winter bug is either wrong or someway off."Every year we say this and then it causes a wave in the summer, driven by new variants coming along more than once a year," warns Prof Woolhouse.  The virus may be looking more There is no political appetite to return to any restrictions. The big decision is going to be around the vaccination programme ahead of next winter - who gets vaccinated and equally importantly with what?Both How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%.Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisors to the federal government, called Economic Sages."We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned," she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to "ramp-up" its use of hydrogen.Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable.After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?Sceptics warn that industry representatives, who globally dominate most hydrogen councils, are often biased in favour of hydrogen as it promises subsidies and keeps up demand for existing assets such as pipelines, tankers, turbines or boilers. They also Meanwhile, environmental groups are cautious, they point out that hydrogen cannot be harvested as a primary fuel. Instead, it has to be made, mainly in two ways, each marked by a colour code.These costs means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.The drawback with this method is that it roughly doubles the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.The US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany's hydrogen strategy: "Merkel's government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition."He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take.However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix."Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry," she argues. "It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production."In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production capacity of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030. That target represents a quarter of the entire EU's aim of 40GW, and is larger than France's goal of 6.5 GW.So while this domestic production expands, Germany is looking to source hydrogen from abroad.Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency, (a government-owned company facilitating the energy transition coordinating the Hydrogen Council), says Germany has dramatically sped-up international negotiations to buy hydrogen.That could include developing hydrogen pipelines to connect to southern Europe, where favourable conditions for solar and wind power allow the cost-efficient production of hydrogen. Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.The first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia.Though he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck's hopes. "Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive," he explains.Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity."Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert," Mr Quaschning says."So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany."Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?On this, most observers agree. "It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany's hydrogen council."So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass," he argues.Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds."Plus, Mr Habeck's new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days," Mr Matthes says.The pressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The property business owned by the monarch but run independently said the new industry could create about 29,000 jobs, including 10,000 in Wales.It is leasing the space to generate enough power for four million homes.But firms looking to win contracts from the plans have urged licensing authorities against delays."It's a big opportunity to create a new sector in Wales and the UK," said the Crown Estate's Nicola Clay."This is absolutely going to happen, interest is growing."Until now most offshore wind farms in the UK have been built into the seabed on fixed foundations.Floating wind farms can be deployed in deeper water  than conventional offshore wind farms, where there is often higher wind, such as off the coast of Pembrokeshire.The wind turbines are floated on massive steel structures and tethered or anchored to the seabed. The Crown Estate tenders will be issued in summer 2023 and could potentially inject £43.6bn into the UK economy by 2050, according to industry body the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult.It could bring new opportunities for Wales as the area of the seabed that the Crown Estate is licensing is 40 miles off south Wales. Of the estimated 29,00 jobs created, some 10,000 would be in Wales, building and running the sites.Areas like Port Talbot and parts of Pembrokeshire have the deep ports, empty sites and skills that the floating wind industry would need. Large open areas of land, a deep port, good connections with the electricity grid, vast amounts of steel as well as manufacturing and metal construction skills are all necessary. The floating wind turbines will be mounted onto huge steel structures that could be assembled on the side of the port at Pembroke Dock and towed out to sea. Ledwood Engineering, based in Pembroke Dock, is one of the local firms that has worked for the oil industry for many years and hopes to win some of that work. As refineries closed locally, the company and employees had to find new work. The firm recently won a large contract to work on the construction of the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. For welders like Ryan Gwyther, that meant jobs in Newcastle, Belfast and beyond. He hopes he will now get work building the structures needed for building floating wind farms."It's my career, welding and pipework. If there was no work here I'd have to move elsewhere," he said.George James, also a welder, said there were few other options in Pembrokeshire. "It is mainly these trades, unless you are going into domestic plumbing," he said.Nick Revell, managing director of Ledwood Engineering, has warned potential jobs could be lost if the public bodies involved in licensing the new industry were too slow."We have the Crown Estate that have got to do work on this and provide good solutions in a timely manner," he said. "Similarly [Natural Resources Wales] NRW, they also have to come to the table and make it work."The Crown Estate said is was working as quickly as possible. Andrea Winterton, marine services manager at Natural Resources Wales, which is responsible for looking after the environment and landscape of Wales' coastal areas, said: "We are working with a number of offshore floating wind and other marine renewable developers with respect to their proposals, as well as with industry representatives, the Crown Estate and Welsh Government at a strategic level. "We offer potential developers pre-application advice and guidance, and work with them throughout their application progress to achieve the sustainable management of our natural resources."She added that this could be seen in the recent marine licensing decision reached for another marine renewables project, Morlais, off the west coast of Anglesey,."We will continue to advise the Crown Estate on their seabed leasing plans for floating offshore wind and continue to work with all our stakeholders to drive forward the crucial work of marine renewable energy in Wales".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The social media giant has filed a petition with the high court in Karnataka state resisting "several" such orders, sources told the BBC.Twitter was reacting to a letter from the government in June warning of "serious consequences" of non-compliance of such orders.Twitter has more than 24 million users in India, by one estimate.Hours after the petition was filed, federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar tweeted that all foreign Internet platforms had to comply with Indian laws. Sources familiar with the matter said the government had warned Twitter in June, saying it was the company's "last opportunity" to comply with a number of blocking orders. They fall under India's information technology law which allows the government to block online content that "threatens the security of the state" and public order among other things. They said Twitter had chosen to go to court due to the "seriousness of the threats" as failure to comply with the law could lead to criminal proceedings.The social media giant believes that the orders are "procedurally and substantially deficient" of the requirements of the law and many of them "demonstrate excessive use of power and are disproportionate," sources said.In several cases, for example, there are demands for entire accounts to be blocked, the sources added. And several accounts could involve content posted by "official handles of political parties".This is the latest move in a continuing face-off between Twitter and India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.Over the past year, authorities have asked the social media giant to remove tweets and block accounts, citing objections based on public order. These include accounts and tweets related to last year's During the farmers' protests Twitter briefly blocked some 250 accounts in response to a legal notice by the government, citing objections based on public order. These included accounts of an investigative news magazine, and activists and groups associated with supporting the months-long protests on the outskirts of Delhi. But Twitter restored the accounts in six hours, citing "insufficient justification" for continuing the suspension.Last year in February, Twitter was told that it was "welcome to do business in India", but it had to follow the laws of the country "irrespective of Twitter's own rules and guidelines".In May, Twitter The police served notice to the site after it labelled a tweet by the BJP as "manipulated media".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : A common fear shared online is that restrictions on movement are being planned. One account told followers to get ready for "monkeypox lockdowns" and "monkeypox tyranny". While fears about the monkeypox outbreak are understandable, scientists say this virus is not like Covid, and most experts think its spread will be limited.  It is much harder to pass on than Covid, we already have available vaccines and treatments, and people appear to be infectious only once symptoms appear - making it easier to spot and isolate.So restrictions such as lockdowns or mass vaccinations are "really not going to be the way to respond to this", says Prof Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Centre at the University of Oxford.  Instead, isolation measures and vaccines are currently being targeted at infected people or their close contacts.  Dr Rosamund Lewis, of the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergencies Programme, confirmed there was no need for mass vaccination, and the WHO has also recommended against any travel restrictions. It's no surprise people's minds now turn to Covid when news of an unfamiliar virus breaks. But the Institute for Strategic Dialogue has noted that recent outbreaks of monkeypox were also "reviving the spread of a set of cut-and-paste... conspiracies" which have been used over the past two years to mislead people during the Covid pandemicSocial media accounts and news outlets in Ukraine, Russia, China and the US have all made accusations that the outbreak was the result of a laboratory leak, or the use of monkeypox as a biological weapon. It's possible to identify where a virus is likely to have come from by sequencing its DNA. Geneticist Fatima Tokhmafshan likens this to scanning a barcode on a parcel to "map the different paths [it] has taken". The genetic sequences we have so far for the virus all trace it back to the strain of monkeypox which commonly circulates in West Africa: "That tells us this is not something manufactured".  There were a "So it's entirely plausible that that's exactly what's happened this time, "says Prof Horby, "and it's by far the most likely scenario." The earliest case identified in the UK in the current outbreak was traced to someone who had travelled from Nigeria.As for the idea that monkeypox escaped from a lab, "there is absolutely no basis for that claim at all", Prof Horby says.There are those claiming online that the current monkeypox outbreak was deliberately planned - with many pointing the finger at Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci, in an echo of Covid conspiracies.  This unfounded assertion is being shared across Russia media, on the Chinese social app Weibo, and on Instagram. It can also be found on Facebook in Romanian, German, English, Arabic, French, Slovenian, Hungarian and Punjabi.The claims point to a document prepared by a US-based biosecurity organisation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). In 2021, NTI conducted a workshop to encourage leaders from around the world to plan for the possibility of future pandemics. The participants were asked to work through a fictional scenario - a "deadly, global pandemic involving an unusual strain of monkeypox virus... [that] spread globally".  "The risks posed by monkeypox", according to the NTI, "have been well documented for years" and cases have been on the increase, making it an obvious virus to choose for this workshop.Outbreaks of infection are a fact of life, so an organisation predicting and planning for them is not in itself suspicious. This claim has taken two forms - some point to the fact the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a virus found in chimpanzees, modified so it cannot replicate and spread. These social media posts then suggest a link between vaccines employing that chimp virus and the monkeypox outbreak.However, monkeypox is caused by a totally different type of virus to the one found in the AstraZeneca vaccine - and is actually thought to be mostly found in rodents, not monkeys. The second type of claim spreading online is that the Covid vaccine somehow suppresses your immune system, making you more vulnerable to other infections. This claim has no basis in reality. Vaccines stimulate - not deplete - your immune system, making it more effective at targeting a particular infection.While there are a very small number of cases of people having autoimmune reactions to vaccines, where your body starts attacking itself (the cause of rare blood clots after AstraZeneca), there is no evidence of vaccines suppressing the immune system or altering your ability to fight other diseases.

m_text : As he walked down the street wearing a Jurassic Park cap, Charles McBryde raised his smartphone, stared at the camera, and hit the record button."Ok, TikTok, I need your help."Charles is 27 and lives in California. His In the video in question, recorded in October 2021, he decided it was time for a confession."I am a climate doomer," he said. "Since about 2019, I have believed that there's little to nothing that we can do to actually reverse climate change on a global scale."Climate doomism is the idea that we are past the point of being able to do anything at all about global warming - and that mankind is highly likely to become extinct.That's wrong, scientists say, but the argument is picking up steam online.Charles admitted to feeling overwhelmed, anxious and depressed about global warming, but he followed up with a plea. "I'm calling on the activists and the scientists of TikTok to give me hope," he said. "Convince me that there's something out there that's worth fighting for, that in the end we can achieve victory over this, even if it's only temporary."And it wasn't long before someone answered.Alaina Wood is a sustainability scientist based in Tennessee. On TikTok she's known as After watching Charles' video, she posted a reply, explaining in simple terms why he was wrong.Alaina makes a habit of challenging climate doomism - a mission she has embraced with a sense of urgency. "People are giving up on activism because they're like, 'I can't handle it any more... This is too much...' and 'If it really is too late, why am I even trying?'" she says. "Doomism ultimately leads to climate inaction, which is the opposite of what we want."Climate scientist Dr Friederike Otto, who has been working with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says: "I don't think it's helpful to pretend that climate change will lead to humanity's extinction."In its most recent report, It involves "rapid, deep and immediate" cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases - which trap the sun's heat and make the planet hotter."There is no denying that there are large changes across the globe, and that some of them are irreversible," says Dr Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. "It doesn't mean the world is going to end - but we have to adapt, and we have to stop emitting."Last year, the Pew Research Center in the US An overwhelming majority of the respondents said they were willing to change the way they lived to tackle the problem.But when asked how confident they were that climate action would significantly reduce the effects of global warming, more than half said they had little to no confidence.Doomism taps into, and exaggerates, that sense of hopelessness. In Charles's case, it all began with a community on Reddit devoted to the potential collapse of civilisation."The most apocalyptic language that I would find was actually coming from former climate scientists," Charles says.It's impossible to know whether the people posting the messages Charles read were genuine scientists.But the posts had a profound effect on him. He admits: "I do think I fell down the rabbit hole."Alaina Wood, the sustainability scientist, says Charles's story is not unusual."I rarely at this point encounter climate denial or any other form of misinformation [on social media]," she says. "It's not people saying, 'Fossil fuels don't cause climate change' ... It's people saying, 'It's too late'."TikTok's rules forbid misinformation that causes harm. We sent the company some videos that Alaina has debunked in the past. None was found to have violated the rules.TikTok says it works with accredited fact-checkers to "limit the spread of false or misleading climate information".Although it can take many forms (and is thus difficult to accurately measure), Alaina says doomism is particularly popular among young people."There's people who are climate activists and they're so scared. They want to make change, but they feel they need to spread fear-based content to do so," she says."Then there are people who know that fear in general goes viral, and they're just following trends, even if they don't necessarily understand the science."I've watched several of the videos that she debunked. Invariably, they feature young users voicing despair about the future. "Let me tell you why I don't know what I want to do with my life and why I'm not planning," says one young woman. "By the year 2050, most of us should be underwater from global warming." But that's a gross exaggeration of what climate scientists are actually telling us."A lot of that is often fatalistic humour, but people on TikTok are interpreting that as fact," Alaina says. But is Charles still among them, after watching Alaina's debunks? Is he still a climate doomer?"I would say no," he tells me. "I have convinced myself that we can get out of this."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The wave of cancellations made over the past weeks will affect tens of thousands hoping to jet off this summer from Heathrow and Gatwick. The industry has been struggling with staff shortages as demand for air travel rebounds. British Airways had already removed 10% of scheduled flights between April and October, but said that "regrettably" more reductions were needed.A spokesperson from the airline, which is the UK's largest, said: "We took pre-emptive action earlier this year to reduce our summer schedule to provide customers with as much notice as possible about any changes to their travel plans."As the entire aviation industry continues to face into the most challenging period in its history, regrettably it has become necessary to make some further reductions."The carrier said it was in touch with customers to "apologise and offer to rebook them or issue a full refund".The wave of cancellations comes BA is expected to announce further cancellations over the summer ahead of the deadline.Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights.On Wednesday, British Airways was also affected by a rare "schedule intervention" by Heathrow Airport. Heathrow asked airlines to cut 30 flights from their Thursday morning schedules, as more passengers were expected than it could deal with.It made the move to ensure the airport had enough security staff on duty for the number of passengers.The cancellations come as Many jobs in the aviation industry were lost during the course of the Covid pandemic and recruiting enough staff in time to deal with the surge in demand for travel has proven difficult for airlines and airports. Gatwick has already said it would be reducing the number of flights during summer because of staff shortages before the airport slots amnesty was announced.And Manchester Airport Thousands of passengers were affected by last-minute flight cancellations over the Easter and half-term holidays.That earlier disruption prompted the government and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to write to airlines telling them to ensure their summer timetables were "deliverable... based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available".Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, from Quebec, Canada, has agreed to plead guilty in a Florida court.The 34-year-old was affiliated to the NetWalker ransomware crew, which has attacked companies, municipalities, hospitals, schools and universities.When he was arrested, police discovered he was in possession of $27m (£22.2m) in Bitcoin.The case represents a rare example of a successful arrest and prosecution of a hacker working for a Russia-based cyber-crime group.US court documents state that the Canadian was one of NetWalker's most prolific affiliates.Evidence gathered by police shows he went on a hacking spree between April and December 2020, attacking 17 Canadian companies and many others around the world. NetWalker operated a ransomware-as-a-service criminal business, offering its malicious software and extortion website to hacker affiliates. The leaders, who are still at large, communicate in Russian online and ensure that their malware does not infect Russian computer systems, or those of former Soviet countries which are now members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Affiliates like Mr Vachon-Desjardins are responsible for identifying and attacking high-value victims with the ransomware.NetWalker developers and affiliates split the ransom or, if the victim refuses to pay, a share of the money made from selling the stolen data.This video can not be playedMr Vachon-Desjardins was arrested in Canada in January 2021 and subsequently extradited following a US investigation into the cyber-crime group, which dismantled its online operation and uncovered a database of affiliate details.It revealed the NetWalker group had roughly 100 members, including affiliates, who extorted at least $40m from victims.In one incident, A NetWalker attack on the Düsseldorf University Clinic in September 2020 is also believed to have contributed to In each incident the victims would find a note on their computers reading: "Hi! Your files are encrypted by NetWalker. "Our encryption algorithms are very strong and your files are very well protected, the only way to get your files back is to co-operate with us and get the decrypter program. For us this is just business."Police seized dozens of computers and storage devices, 719 Bitcoin worth approximately C$35m ($27m, £22m) and C$790,000 in cash from Mr Vachon-Desjardins' house. The hacker is a former IT consultant for Canada's public works and government services department. On his LinkedIn profile, he says he worked for various government departments from 2010 onwards, and cites expertise in responding to cyber-security incidents.He is pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud, and one count of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer. The court has agreed not to proceed with two other charges.He will be sentenced at a later date, and could face 10 years in prison.

m_text : Eric Holder, 32, was convicted by a jury in California on Wednesday after six hours of deliberations.Hussle, born Ermias Asghedom, was shot outside his LA clothing store. The 33-year-old had reportedly known the killer for several years.Following his death, tributes were paid from across the music industry.Holder was also found guilty of two counts of attempted manslaughter as two other men were shot in the incident. He could get life in prison when he is sentenced in September.He belonged to the same street gang as Hussle and had previously admitted to killing him. Witnesses say he left the scene after a ten minute argument, in which Hussle warned him of rumours that he was co-operating with police, and returned with two handguns. His defence team argued that he attacked him in the "heat of passion" but the jury agreed that the attack was premeditated.At the 2019 BET Awards, Hussle was posthumously given the Best Male Hip Hop Artist and Humanitarian Awards.Over 20,000 people attended a celebration of his life, with former US President Barack Obama praising him for leaving "a legacy worth of celebration".Hussle, a former gang member in Los Angeles, had become a community organiser and used the money he made from music to fund improvements to his neighbourhood. After his death he was praised as a "West Coast hero" by members of the city council, who unanimously voted to re-name an intersection "Nipsey Hussle Square" in his south LA neighbourhood.Bryannita Nicholson, a woman who was in a casual relationship with Holder and unwittingly drove him to and from the murder scene, testified in court during the trial that she saw Holder load a gun before the shooting. She said that they spotted the rapper on the street outside his Marathon clothing store while they were picking up a food order. Holder rushed over and she said she heard him loudly tell the rapper: "Did you say I snitched?".Ms Nicholson added that she posed for a photo with Hussle while Holder went to collect the food. The witness, who came forward to police leading to Holder's arrest, said that she saw Holder eat some food before he left her car to kill Hussle.  Last week, Holder was attacked in jail by "multiple individuals" his public defender told CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US. He was reportedly cut with a razor, and taken to hospital where he had a wound to his head closed with staples.

m_text : Now, the prime minister has lost the support of his MPs and is set to resign. How did it come to this?On Wednesday 29 June, the MP Chris Pincher - at the time, the Conservative deputy chief whip - went to a private members' club in London. In his words, he "drank far too much" He was accused of groping two men, which led to a flurry of allegations, some dating back years. It set off a chain of events that ended with the prime minister's downfall.First, Downing Street said Mr Johnson was not aware of "specific allegations" about Mr Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip in February. Ministers later reiterated this line - even though it turned out to be inaccurate.On 4 July, the BBC reported Mr Johnson had been aware of a formal complaint. The next day, a former civil servant - Lord McDonald - said the prime minister had been told of the complaint in person.Mr Johnson then admitted he had been told in 2019, and apologised for appointing Mr Pincher as deputy chief whip.This video can not be playedIn April this year, the prime minister was He also apologised for going to a "bring your own booze" party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown.More widely, the Metropolitan Police issued 126 fines to 83 people for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall.And a report by Sue Gray - a senior civil servant - described a series of social events by political staff that "The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture," she wrote.Last December, Mr Johnson told the Commons that "all guidance was followed completely in No 10". He is now being investigated by a Commons committee over Inflation has risen sharply in 2022, Many of the reasons were outside of Boris Johnson's control. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, has led to rises in oil prices and the cost of food.And, while the government has taken some steps - for example, by cutting fuel duty by 5p per litre - it also went ahead The government said the tax rise would pay for health and social care, and changes that kicked in this week "In the middle of the worst cost of living crisis for decades," said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in April, "the government chooses to increase taxes on working people".In October 2021, a House of Commons committee recommended a 30-day suspension for then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson. The committee said he broke lobbying rules, to try to benefit companies who paid him.But the Conservatives - led by the prime minister - After an outcry, This video can not be playedBoris Johnson won his thumping majority on the back of a clear, easy-to-follow policy - Get Brexit Done.But since then, his critics said, there was a lack of focus and ideas in Downing Street.His ex-adviser turned chief critic, Dominic Cummings, repeatedly accused him of being an out-of-control shopping trolley, veering from position to position.Others questioned the prime minister's philosophy - or, indeed, if he had one. In June, Conservative MP and former minister Jeremy Hunt accused Mr Johnson of lacking Mr Hunt was speaking before a confidence vote, which Mr Johnson won - but the complaints were getting louder. The But that, now, is not the concern of Conservative MPs. They have spoken, and the prime minister is going.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : They will have to secure the backing of Tory MPs, with the final two candidates going to a ballot of Conservative members. But who are the potential candidates?Remember, most of these MPs and ministers have not yet said whether they want the job of Tory leader and PM - but they are the ones to watch.Rishi Sunak was once seen by some as a sparkling possibility for a future Conservative leader. But the last few months has seen his reputation dented following a controversy He only became an MP in 2015 -  for the North Yorkshire constituency of Richmond. Few outside of Westminster had heard of him, but he was Chancellor of the Exchequer by February 2020. He quickly had to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, spending huge amounts of money trying to keep the economy afloat during lockdown.Splurging the cash didn't come easily to a man who saw himself as a low tax and spend Conservative on the Thatcherite wing of the party but it did boost his popularity.His early move to quit the cabinet with fellow minister and friend Sajid Javid may just have paved the way for the stream of ministerial resignations that eventually forced Boris Johnson out. The foreign secretary was early in declaring her support for Johnson after the departure of his chancellor and health secretary, bolstering her standing among loyalists.As only the second woman to lead the Foreign Office, she has taken credit for securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after six years and for imposing sanctions on Russia and its oligarchs.First elected in 2010 as MP for South West Norfolk, Ms Truss has become a popular figure among Conservative Party members for her libertarian views on economics and trade.But her style has not always caught on with the wider public, and she was was mocked for giving a speech at the 2015 Conservative conference which featured an impassioned section on UK cheese imports.That did not impede her progress, and she held a series of cabinet positions - including negotiating post-Brexit trade agreements as international trade secretary - before reaching her current role.The MP for Bromsgrove dealt the prime minister the first blow, stressing the need for integrity and telling MPs in his resignation speech that he had concluded: "the problem starts at the top".Mr Javid previously bid for the leadership in 2019, making it to the final four before dropping out to support Mr Johnson.His endorsement was rewarded with the role of chancellor, but he quit after six months in a row over his advisers, before making a dramatic return to the front benches as health secretary in 2021.A fiscal conservative, who has repeatedly warned about the dangers of rising inflation and the national debt, Mr Javid rose from modest beginnings.He was born in Rochdale in 1969 to a first generation Pakistani immigrant family and his father worked as a bus conductor. Mr Javid pursued a successful career in the City before becoming a Tory MP in 2010.The levelling up secretary has run twice before for Tory leader and prime minister. In 2019 he came third to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt.But his most famous intervention in leadership contests came in 2016, in the wake of the EU referendum, during which he had been a senior figure on the Leave side.Having originally backed his Leave colleague Mr Johnson, he sensationally withdrew support, saying "reluctantly" that Mr Johnson could not "provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead".Away from all this, the former BBC journalist and Times newspaper columnist is one of the longer-serving ministers in the cabinet. In 2010 he became education secretary and since then has taken up government roles as chief whip, justice secretary, environment secretary and most recently levelling up secretary.The current chancellor cemented his reputation as a safe pair of hands when he took on the role of vaccines minister in the pandemic, and garnered much credit for the UK's successful rollout.It was, he said, "the most important job I'll ever do" - although it set the stage for a promotion to the cabinet as education secretary.Another promotion to chancellor following Rishi Sunak's resignation did not stop him from joining a group of ministers 24 hours later to tell Mr Johnson it was time to go.Born in Iraq in 1967, Mr Zahawi and his family were forced to flee when Saddam Hussein came to power.After studying chemical engineering, he set up a firm selling Teletubbies merchandise before making his fortune with the founding of online polling company YouGov. He became MP for the safe Conservative seat of Stratford-Upon-Avon in 2010.The former foreign secretary has remained an influential presence in Westminster from the backbenches since he came second to Boris Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest.He scrutinised government policy throughout the pandemic as chair of the Commons Health Committee.But if he stands again for the leadership, he will be hoping party members take a different view from three years ago, when he said his vote for Remain in the Brexit referendum was a hurdle that could not be overcome.The son of an admiral, Mr Hunt made his fortune by setting up Hotcourses - a website which connected prospective students with educational institutions. MP for South West Surrey since 2005, Mr Hunt joined the government in 2010 as culture secretary and also led the Department of Health.Even before it became clear that Boris Johnson would resign, Suella Braverman boldly declared her intent to stand as a candidate but also remain in the cabinet as Attorney General, the government's senior law officer. She set out her pitch for the leadership as the enemy of what she called "woke rubbish".One of the original lights of the Brexit-focused European Research Group, she was a passionate Brexiteer and has always been a staunch supporter of Mr Johnson. She became the first cabinet-level minister to take maternity leave - the law had to be changed to enable her to take time off.As a former magician's assistant, Penny Mordaunt has a track record of pulling off extraordinary feats.In political terms, she already pulled a rabbit out of a hat in 2019, when she made history by becoming the UK's first female defence secretary - a natural fit for a naval reservist who had already served as armed forces minister under David Cameron.But Ms Mordaunt is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! to raise money for charity.MP for Portsmouth North since 2010, Ms Mordaunt is a former head of the Conservative Party's youth wing and was a press officer for William Hague when he was party leader.Before entering Westminster politics, she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, when she supported British truckers during French blockades.The defence secretary and former soldier is a low-profile figure who has drawn increasing attention since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as the UK made an early decision to support Kyiv with weapons and training.Despite his opposition to Brexit, Mr Wallace previously led Boris Johnson's unsuccessful 2017 leadership campaign, before being rewarded with a cabinet post in 2019.While in the Scots Guards, he is said to have broken the record for the largest ever bill at the bar in the officers' mess.He served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland where he thwarted an IRA effort to carry out a bomb attack against British soldiers.He was also one of the main army personnel involved in recovering Princess Diana's body from Paris. Tom Tugendhat's style is the polar opposite of Boris Johnson's - a moderate who projects pragmatism rather than populism, a details man who supported Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.For these attributes, Mr Tugendhat, who was elected as MP for Tonbridge in 2015, has been talked up as a potential future leader of the Conservative Party for years.His stint as chairman of the influential Foreign Affairs Select Committee since January 2020 has added weight to his leadership credentials as he drew on his military expertise to scrutinise issues such as China's growing global influence.In an emotional speech to MPs, Mr Tugendhat described the anger, grief and rage felt by veterans at the "abandonment" of Afghanistan in a hasty withdrawal by western forces in August last year.Asked in 2017 whether he would like to be prime minister, he said: "Of course. I bought a ticket so why wouldn't I want to win the lottery?"Another leading light in the Brexiteer movement, if not a household name, Steve Baker has made it known that colleagues have "implored" him to stand in the leadership. He has been seen as a brutally effective organiser, an MP who behind the scenes harried Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, until she finally resigned. He was an RAF engineer, and became MP for High Wycombe in the 2010 general election.Under the current rules, candidates need the support of eight Conservative MPs to stand.If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs hold a series of votes until just two remain.At that point there is a ballot of the wider Conservative party membership to select the winner.The timescale for each contest is decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, and the committee could vote to change the rules before the contest takes place.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : He quits Downing Street after less than three years in the job, despite having won a huge majority in the 2019 general election. Outgoing prime ministers are usually expected to stay in office until a successor is found. But how does that happen? Once a Conservative leader has stood down, an election for a new party leader is triggered. Under the current rules, candidates need the support of eight Conservative MPs to stand.Once all the candidates have declared - if there are more than two candidates - Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain.When two MPs are left, all Conservative Party members around the country - so not just MPs - will vote for the winner.The timescale for each contest is decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, and the committee could vote to change the rules before the contest takes place. Whoever wins the contest to lead the Conservatives, will become the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs in Parliament.The Queen will therefore ask them to form a government.No.When a prime minister resigns, there is not automatically a general election.The latest an election can be held is Mr Johnson intends to continue as prime minister until a new leader is in place.That means he would stay in office until the Conservatives choose a new leader, as his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron did when they resigned.In his resignation statement he said: "I've agreed with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of our backbench MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week."And I've today appointed a Cabinet to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place."Some of his critics are calling on Mr Johnson to leave No 10 immediately rather than waiting for a successor to be chosen.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says if Mr Johnson is not removed at once, he would call a vote of no confidence. Under a motion of no confidence, all MPs - not just Conservatives - would get to vote. One more MP voting in favour than voting against would be required for it to pass.  Such an outcome, however, would rely on Conservative MPs voting against their own government - which could be unlikely. At the moment, there is no obvious successor to Mr Johnson, but there are several potential candidates.Former Cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid have both previously stood for leadership and may choose to do so again.Other possible contenders include:Until he officially gives up the office of prime minister, Mr Johnson still has the same powers, in theory. In reality, he now lacks the authority to introduce any radical new policies. He will still represent the UK abroad and can continue to make public appointments or changes to his team of ministers.One of his final acts in office is likely to be awarding knighthoods and appointments to the House of Lords in his resignation honours list.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Fifty-two years after the classic came out, Jenny Agutter reprises her role as Bobbie in The Railway Children Return.She said returning to Oakworth station in West Yorkshire for the new film was like "going right back in time".Agutter was joined by her new co-stars Sheridan Smith, Sir Tom Courtenay and John Bradley at the station.The sequel is set almost 40 years after the first film, with Roberta, known as Bobbie, now a grandmother who takes in a new set of children who arrive on the railway - evacuees fleeing World War Two bombs in Salford."It's really lovely when something comes around again, and in a different way," said Agutter, 69, who played Bobbie in the beloved 1970 family film and a 1968 TV series.They were both based on E Nesbit's novel, which was set in 1905 and followed a family who were forced to move from their wealthy life in London to a run-down cottage in Yorkshire when the children's father went to prison.For the sequel, Agutter and the writers filled in the story of what her character had gone on to do, given the changes in British life."She would have been definitely a suffragette," Agutter said, speaking at the station, which was also a filming location for the follow-up."Probably a magistrate. Very involved with young people and social issues and making these changes. The feminism through it is really interesting from 1905 to 1944."Agutter, who is also known for playing Sister Julienne in the BBC's Call the Midwife, added: "I think Nesbit would have approved. I think she would she would love to see it carry on and the story carry on."The sequel includes numerous nods to the original film, as well as replicas of memorable props."When I was taken to the set, they had created a home that was filled with Roberta's childhood memories - the little paper theatre, the train that Peter would have had, lots of things that I was really deeply touched by," said Agutter."I mean, it was like stepping back. It felt like a part of my life."This time, Beau Gadson plays the eldest of the new generation of railway children, the feisty Lily.Despite being born almost four decades after the original film came out, she says she was a fan before she went up for the part in the sequel."It's a British classic. I had to have seen it. I've read all the books. I've even seen the theatre production where a real steam train came in."Gadson, who played the young Princess Margaret in The Crown, said Agutter "helped us a lot" during filming."She was great to have on set," the 15-year-old said. "I mean, the original Bobbie coming down to this station again? It was amazing."The new film brings in Smith as Bobbie's daughter, and Game of Thrones actor Bradley as the grandson of Bernard Cribbins' stationmaster Mr Perks.After interviews and photographs at Oakworth station, the cast boarded a steam train to a screening in Keighley.Writer Danny Brocklehurst said they tried not to think about risking the legacy of such a well-loved film."When we were writing, we weren't sat there with the original on our shoulder, thinking, oh my gosh, we must honour this enchanting beloved classic."It was like, let's do a new film that tells a story about new characters - evacuees in the Second World War."We very much wanted to keep to the spirit of the original and keep some of the themes and the tone of the original, but bring it to a new audience with a new story."The film's Yorkshire-based producer Jemma Rodgers first came up with the idea for the sequel, and a strand of the story about black US soldiers stationed in the county being attacked by US military police officers.That was based on a true incident in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, where soldiers and military police got into a gun battle in 1943, leaving one of the soldiers dead."Because of my own mixed heritage, I was very interested in stories about black people before Windrush in the UK," Rodgers said. "And I came across the story of Bamber Bridge, which I had never heard of before."The real-life trouble arose after the white American military police and officers tried to impose racial segregation in the town."The villagers said, we're not doing that here. And they did the opposite - they put signs up in the window saying, 'Only black troops allowed and locals'," Rodgers explained."One night, there was a fight with the MPs [military police] and it was awful. Sixteen people got arrested, somebody got shot."But the thing that was really inspiring to me was that the locals fought with the black GIs. They just saw unfairness. They didn't see colour."In the film, which is released on 15 July, Pose actor KJ Aikens plays a character who is discovered by the children after being targeted by military police.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Civilians boarded minibuses on Wednesday morning as Russian forces advanced from the north and east.UK defence intelligence said there was a "realistic possibility" the battle for Slovyansk would be the next key contest in the struggle for the Donbas.Russian forces were likely to be 16km (10 miles) north of the city, it said.Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russians had turned the entire Donetsk region into a hotspot where it was dangerous for a civilian to remain. "I call on everyone to evacuate, evacuation saves lives," he said on his social media feed.Russia switched its focus to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region in March, after a failed bid to capture the capital Kyiv. It has taken control of Luhansk region, to the north and east of Slovyansk, and has now pushed on to the rest of Donetsk. The industrial Donbas embraces Donetsk and Luhansk.Russian commentators said the fall of the last city in Luhansk had cleared the way for an advance towards towns to the west and south. However, Ukraine's regional chief in Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said the military continued to frustrate Russian forces on the border with Donetsk region, particularly around the main road from Lysychansk to Bakhmut.Russian military expert Vladislav Shurygin told Izvestia newspaper that it would take the army several days to clear mines, but the next large-scale battles would be for Slovyansk and neighbouring Kramatorsk, as well as pushing Ukrainian forces out of range of the city of Donetsk.Slovyansk was seized by Russian-backed forces when the war first erupted in 2014, but recaptured two and a half months later. As residents remembered the anniversary of the army's success on Tuesday, Russian artillery pounded the city, setting the market on fire.Elsewhere in Ukraine, a civilian was killed early on Wednesday in a Russian cruise missile strike on a cafe in the southern Mykolaiv region, local leaders said. And in Kharkiv in the north a security guard was killed when a university building was shelled overnight.Irish leader Micheál Martin visited some of the towns around Kyiv on Wednesday which had suffered serious damage in Russia's bombardment. The Taoiseach also went to the site of a mass grave in Bucha where residents had been murdered. Although Russian forces pulled back from around Kyiv a month into the invasion, Russian Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev has reiterated that the Kremlin's main aim is still to replace Ukraine's leaders and capture a broad swathe of its territory.A close ally of the Russian leader, he repeated President Vladimir Putin's earlier claims of "de-Nazifying" and demilitarising Ukraine, saying that those goals would be achieved despite Western military aid to Kyiv. In reality Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has no connection to the far right: he is a former comedian, democratically elected and ethnically Jewish.A measure of Mr Putin's thinking at the time of the invasion was revealed in a French documentary last week, which broadcast a tense nine-minute phone call in which he told President Emmanuel Macron that President Zelensky was not democratically elected and came to power during a bloodbath when people were burned alive.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that broadcasting the call was a breach of diplomatic etiquette, although Russia had nothing to be ashamed of.This video can not be playedHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.
