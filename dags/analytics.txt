m_text : This video can not be playedA Russian-Ukrainian family has been irrevocably split by the war in Ukraine after Russian-born Ekaterina Volkova was injured in an air strike and her Ukrainian husband killed in the same attack.This was the second time Russia had dropped a missile on their apartment building. In late April, a Radio Liberty journalist was killed in the same building. Ukrainian authorities said the incident showed Russia’s indiscriminate bombing was even targeting their own citizens. The BBC’s Anastassiya Zlatopolskai has tracked down the family in Kyiv who say the attack was unforgivable. Producer: Hanna Tsyba© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedAs Japan struggles to deal with the hottest early summer on record, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the country must quickly restart more of its nuclear power plants.For the first time ever June temperatures broke through 40C last week - and Japan's power stations are struggling to keep up. But 11 years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster the push to restart Japan's nuclear plants remains deeply unpopular. At the Fukushima site they are preparing to release over a million tonnes of treated cooling water in to the Pacific Ocean. The BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes went back to the plant to meet local fishing communities who are ardently opposed to the release of the water.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedWatch: The prime minister's home on fire, after protesters broke in and set it alightNeither the PM nor the president were in the buildings at the time.Hundreds of thousands descended on the capital Colombo, calling for Mr Rajapaksa to resign after months of protests over economic mismanagement.Mr Rajapaksa will step down on 13 July. PM Wickremesinghe has agreed to resign.The speaker of parliament said the president decided to step down "to ensure a peaceful handover of power" and called on the public to "respect the law". The announcement triggered an eruption of celebratory fireworks in the city. Political leaders are due to hold further meetings to discuss a smooth transition of power. Sri Lanka's military has appealed to people to cooperate with security forces to maintain calm.After Saturday's events, the United States appealed to the Sri Lankan leadership to act promptly to resolve the country's economic crisis.One protester, Fiona Sirmana, who was demonstrating at the president's house, said it was time "to get rid of the president and the prime minister and to have a new era for Sri Lanka"."I feel very, very sad that they didn't go earlier because had they gone earlier there wouldn't have been any destruction," she told Reuters.Dozens of people were injured in Saturday's protests, and a spokesperson for Colombo's main hospital told AFP news agency that three people were being treated for gunshot wounds. Sri Lanka is suffering rampant inflation and is struggling to import food, fuel and medicine amid the country's worst economic crisis in 70 years.It has run out of foreign currency and has had to impose a ban on sales of petrol and diesel for private vehicles, leading to days-long queues for fuel. The extraordinary events of Saturday appeared to be the culmination of months of mainly peaceful protests in Sri Lanka. Huge crowds converged on the official residence of President Rajapaksa, chanting slogans and waving the national flag before breaking through the barricades and entering the property. Footage online showed people roaming through the house and swimming in the president's pool, while others emptied out a chest of drawers, picked through the president's belongings and used his luxurious bathroom. The contrast between the luxury of the palace and the months of hardship endured by the country's 22 million people was not lost on the protesters. "When the whole country is under such strain people have come here to release that pressure. When you see the luxuries in this house it is obvious that they don't have time to work for the country," Chanuka Jayasuriya told Reuters. These are some extraordinary times for Sri Lanka. After a day of fury and violence, the two senior leaders of the country have agreed to step down. The news triggered jubilation at the main protest site in Colombo. Firecrackers were set off in many parts of the city. I am at the Galle Face protest site - many protesters have started returning home, thousands are still present. Some have been singing and playing musical instruments, celebrating.  What a turnaround of events. A few days ago a photo of President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe smiling in parliament was widely shared on social media. Many vented their anger, saying the two men appeared to be happy while millions were struggling to eat three meals a day. But a week is a long time in politics. Mr Rajapaksa vacated his official residence on Friday as a safety precaution ahead of the planned protests, two defence ministry sources said, according to Reuters. Although it is Mr Rajapaksa's official residence, he usually sleeps at a separate house nearby.The BBC has been unable to confirm the president's whereabouts.Protesters also set fire to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's private home in an affluent neighbourhood of Colombo.He said earlier that he was willing to resign to ensure the safety of civilians and to make way for an all-party government, but soon after his announcement videos started circulating of his house up in flames. The prime minister lives with his family in the private home and uses his official residence for official business only.Whether or not the president's and the prime minister's planned resignations will be enough to appease the protesters is not yet clear.  "Just two resignations alone will not satisfy the demands, the demand of a system change, but at least this is a start if the president and the prime minister depart," said Bhavani Fonseka, a prominent human rights lawyer in Colombo."There has to be a peaceful transition of power which is yet to be seen," she warned.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Those who died in these attacks, on a single day in June, are all thought to be civilians. Deaths like theirs account for more than one out of every three of those recorded in Ukraine since 24 February, according to BBC News analysis of data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled) - a US-based non-profit group that records political violence.Experts say the total number of recorded deaths is likely to be a severe underestimate. Ukraine and Russia claim the number reaches into the tens of thousands - but their claims do not match up and cannot be independently verified.To try to understand the human cost of the war, it is necessary to look at a number of sources, including the United Nations, national governments and independent monitors.This map shows where deaths have been reported during the war, up to mid-June. The southern and eastern areas of Ukraine, along the Russian border where the main ground invasion began, have borne the brunt of the violence.The data is from Acled, which, in Ukraine, counts individual incidences of violence such as armed clashes or air strikes, and their locations, once confirmed by local media and partner organisations, meaning the number of deaths it reports is more conservative than other sources. Overall, Acled has reported more than 10,000 deaths in Ukraine since the conflict began.Mariupol, in the south-east, Kharkiv, in the north-east, and Bilohorivka, in the east, have seen some of the heaviest casualties.From Acled's totals, BBC News has identified about 3,600 civilian deaths as of mid-June, while the UN has confirmed about 4,700 during the conflict up to the end of the month.Both say their figures fall far short of the actual number of deaths, because of the challenges in checking information while war is raging.The UN seeks to verify each death using police, hospital or other civil records. But Acled's data includes only those associated with a confirmed specific event - and not people who die as a direct result of the war but for other reasons such as hunger or lack of healthcare.This is particularly important"In total, we estimate [in addition to the confirmed deaths] that at least 3,000 civilians have died in besieged or contested cities because they couldn't get medical care and because of the stress on their health amid the hostilities," head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Matilda Bogner says.The leading cause of civilian deaths in Ukraine is shelling and air strikes, according to both UN reporting and BBC News analysis of Acled data.However, almost 1,000 civilians have been killed in Under the Geneva Convention and other international treaties, deliberately attacking civilians or the infrastructure vital to their survival Ukraine's prosecutor-general has accused Russia of Russia has denied all accusations.The number of soldiers dying is sensitive information and shapes the story of how the war is going for both sides, Gavin Crowden, of casualty-recording organisation Every Casualty Counts, says. "That is something that both sides will be very conscious of," he says.Ukraine has given no official total of soldiers killed during the war. But in early June, a senior Ukrainian presidential aide told BBC News 100-200 Ukrainian solders were dying in the Donbas region every day.In April, Russia said it had killed about 23,000 Ukrainian troops. Russia rarely discloses its own troop fatalities. Its most recent death count was on 25 March, when it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began. In April, the UK government said about 15,000 Russian soldiers had died.Ukraine regularly releases figures on Russian military deaths, claiming about 35,000 Russians had died as of late June.None of these claims can be verified.The UN has said it does not consider figures released by those involved in the conflict to be reliable.However, at least 4,010 Russian soldiers' deaths have beenOf those identified, 685 were officers and four were generals. Most were of lower rank, privates and non-commissioned officers (NCOs).These soldiers, whose bodies were repatriated to Russia, have been identified by name through state media, social media, official reports by local authorities and speaking to people who knew them.The number of soldiers whose bodies remain in Ukraine, or have yet to be identified, is unknown."Every day, the war takes dozens of civilian lives and the lives of combatants," Ms Bogner says."If human lives matter, these figures speak for themselves."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Some 3,988 square kilometres (1,540 square miles) of land were cleared in the region between January and June.Last year, 3,088 square kilometres of the rainforest were destroyed during the same period.The Amazon plays an essential role in the planet's oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles, absorbing vast amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Environmentalists blame the increasing levels of deforestation on Brazil's right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has rolled back environmental protections.Brazil's environment ministry said it had been forceful in fighting environmental crimes, although in a statement it failed to mention the spike in deforestation. The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest, but its trees are felled for their wood and to clear space for crops that in turn supply global food companies.The high level of deforestation is also feeding a higher than usual number of fires for this time of year, Dr Manoela Machado from the University of Oxford told Reuters news agency. After trees are cut down, fires are often set in order to clear the land for agriculture, so more deforestation means more fires, Dr Machado said. As well as being rich in biodiversity, the area is home to communities who say they need to use the forest for mining and commercial farming in order to make a living.At the same time, indigenous communities living in the Amazon fight to protect the rainforest and their ways of life.They said there were signs of a loss of resilience in more than 75% of the forest, with trees taking longer to recover from the effects of droughts largely driven by climate change, as well as human impacts such as deforestation and fires.At the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow last year, more than 100 governments promised to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030.This video can not be playedA logger, an environmental policeman, a cattle rancher and an environmentalist share their views on the Amazon's futureHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Government operations have also been hit by the Rogers Communications issue. The company says it is working rapidly to resolve the nationwide problem."We know how important it is for our customers to stay connected," the company said in a statement.It is not known what caused the outage, which is the second one in 15 months. It began at around 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT). Internet traffic had dropped to around 75% of its normal level by Friday morning, according to NetBlocks, an internet watchdog organisation. Rogers is the mobile carrier of nearly 11 million Canadians, with a stake in everything from hockey to cable television. Toronto's police department tweeted that some mobile phone users were having trouble calling the emergency services, despite it remaining "fully operational". "If the call connects please stay on the call as long as possible," the force wrote, adding that people who cannot connect should call back.Police in Ottawa tweeted: "If your call fails, please try again, or call from a landline or cellphone with another provider.″The outages have also hit passport offices, courthouses and transit payment systems.  On-call medical employees for the Scarborough Health Network, which operates hospitals in Toronto, have been asked to come into work until the issue is resolved.In the Quebec province, a Montreal court delayed a trial hearing for disgraced fashion mogul Peter Nygard after jail officials were unable to connect him to a videoconference system. In urban areas, people have flocked to cafes and places with functioning Wi-Fi. "There's tonnes of people here with their laptops just working away ferociously, the same as they would at home, because they've got no service at home," one Starbucks customer in Toronto told Reuters. On Friday afternoon, the vice-president of Rogers told CBC that the company was still working to identify the "root cause" of the issue. "As of now, we don't have an ETA of when the problem will be fixed," said Kye Prigg."I wouldn't like to say whether it's going to be fully online today or not," he said, also declining to say whether cyberhackers may be to blame. This is the second major outage to affect Rogers in just over a year.

The Kremlin has said Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Iran's capital, Tehran, on 19 July. He is expected to meet Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan for peace talks on Syria.This video can not be playedWatch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops (March 2022 report)Mr Sullivan added that intelligence received by the US supported the view that Russia's assault on eastern Ukraine was "coming at a cost to the sustainment of its own weapons".He also observed that Iranian drones had previously been used by Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack Saudi Arabia.His comments came ahead of US President Joe Biden's visit to Israel and Saudi Arabia this week. Neither country has so far joined sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine.Israel sees Iran, which calls for its elimination, as its biggest regional threat.The US and other allies have supplied billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Ukraine since the invasion in February.

m_text : The country has seen nothing like it since the death of Emperor Hirohito in 1989. Abe, the country's longest serving post-war prime minister, inspired respect rather than love. In fact, opinion polls repeatedly showed that most Japanese weren't overly fond of him, even though they kept voting for him. So what is behind their grief? It's partly driven by shock at the way he died - gunned down while delivering a speech at a campaign event. There's an inability to comprehend that such an outrageous death could take place in Japan, where gun crimes and political violence are so rare. But with his death, there is also a growing realisation of what Abe gave Japan. First and foremost, that was stability and security.Before Abe returned to power in 2012, Japan had just suffered its biggest trauma since World War Two - a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. The governing coalition was in chaos. The Japanese economy had still not recovered from its 1992 stock market collapse, and over the previous two decades, Japan had seen 14 prime ministers come and go. One of them lasted just 64 days. Abe swept back into office with a real sense of energy, and most importantly, an economic plan that he conveniently dubbed "Abenomics". He declared "Japan is back". He announced a "big bazooka" of cash that would flood the financial markets with liquidity and force prices upwards even as interest rates were dropped below zero. As prices rose, and with nowhere to put their cash, people were compelled to spend, creating growth, and pushing up wages. Did "Abenomics" work? Not really. But the stock market soared, employment picked up and the man in the prime minister's office appeared to know what he was doing.  Economics was actually never Abe's strong suit. His lifelong obsession was national security. And that's where his true legacy lies. Abe sought to build an alliance of what he called "like-minded democracies", including India and Australia. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Quad, an alliance between the US, Japan, India and Australia. But the key to Japan's security policy is "Article 9" - in Japan, everybody knows what you mean when you say the words. It's a crucial part of the constitution that makes Japan a "pacifist nation". It was put there by the victorious Americans after World War Two, and Japanese nationalists have been railing against it ever since. They claim it makes Japan weak, unable to stand up for itself or defend its allies. In a post-Cold War world, with the threat from China and North Korea rising, Abe was determined that Article 9 had to go. "The idea of the constitution was that Japan should rely on the goodwill of the world for its security," says Kazuhiko Togo, a former senior diplomat and friend of Abe.  "It's nonsense. So, Abe wanted to get out from this fallacy," he adds.  But how? Changing Japan's constitution is extremely hard. It needs a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, and the support of a national referendum. Abe knew that was all but impossible. So, he came up with another solution - he would pass a law "re-interpreting" the meaning of Article 9. To Mr Togo that was a stroke of genius."He changed the interpretation of Article 9, so that if the United States is attacking in the vicinity of Japan then it's as if Japan is attacked, and that would allow us to assert our right to collective self-defence. The implication is huge," he explains.That is, if the United States enters a war to, let's say, defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, Japan can join as well. Abe's critics agree that the implications are huge, but they also see them as troubling. "I think Mr Abe's argument [about Article 9] would have been more convincing if he had the courage and honesty to do it from the front door rather than doing everything through the back door," says Professor Koichi Nakano, a political scientist."It's like Article 9 was thrown out of the window without having even been formally discussed and formally amended." Even Abe's supporters admit his was an incomplete legacy. But after Sunday's election, his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may now be in a position to push through the constitutional change he had always sought. The governing coalition led by LDP already had a two-thirds majority in the lower house. And it slightly increased its majority in the upper house in polls held two days after Abe's killing. But more importantly, a right-wing party, Ishin no Kai, has significantly upped its share of seats in the upper house. While it's not a coalition partner, it supports constitutional revision and would therefore vote in favour of it. That vote would cement Abe's legacy.In some ways, Abe was ahead of his time. Since he stepped down in 2020 for health reasons, Russia has invaded Ukraine and China's intentions towards Taiwan have become ever clearer. Japan is now concerned both at China's increasingly aggressive and frequent intrusions in to Japanese-controlled waters around the Senkaku islands (which China also claims), and Beijing's air and naval activity around Taiwan. Taiwan's northern coast is only 100km south of Japan's southernmost sea border. So Japan is also aware of the possibility that any conflict over Taiwan would inevitably draw in the United States - and due to the large US military bases in Japan, effect Japan directly as well. All of this has led to a shift in Japanese public opinion - a majority of the people now support an increase in defence spending. Perhaps it is finally time for Japan to have that honest conversation about Article 9.

m_text : After more than four months of repeated Ukrainian bombardment, Russian forces have abandoned Snake orRussia says it has withdrawn its garrison as a "gesture of goodwill" to prove it was not obstructing grain exports, but Ukraine dismissed that claim, as Moscow continued to shell its grain stores.The island is exposed to attacks from all directions from air and sea, and the small garrison tasked with defending it - first Ukrainians and later Russians - has been described as "sitting ducks" by military experts. Seized by the Russians on 24 February, Snake Island is located just 35km (22 miles) off Ukraine's coast - well within the range of missile, artillery and drone strikes from the shore.And Ukraine's armed forces have done exactly that, claiming a series of devastating attacks on the island itself and any vessel bringing troop deployments and heavy weaponry.In April, Russia's anti-aircraft capabilities in the north-western Black Sea were significantly weakened with the sinking of the Moskva, That explains why the Kremlin was so desperate to bring in anti-aircraft systems and radio-electronic warfare to Snake Island. But it became a logistical nightmare for Russia to defend because it was so far from its main naval bases in the Black Sea.For all its attacks, Ukraine has very limited naval capacity, so has been unable to land its own force on the island. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov argues that stationing troops on Snake Island makes no sense for either side as they would become an easy target.  Instead, Mr Zhdanov advocates creating "fire control" - maintaining the capability to strike any target approaching the island.That would also give greater security to Ukraine's biggest Black Sea port of Odesa, and the whole north-western sector of the Black Sea.Russia already controls a large stretch of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, plus the Crimean Peninsula and the entire Sea of Azov. Holding Snake Island completed an effective blockade of Odesa, and meant exports of the vast majority of Ukrainian grain were impossible.It also meant the Black Sea coast became vulnerable to attack too, and military experts in Kyiv voiced fears that Russia could install long-range air defences, such as an S-400 air missile system.A look at the map also shows that Russian control of the island represented a threat to Nato member Romania - both its key port of Constanta and traffic in the mouth of the River Danube. It is not just strategically significant - this area is also rich in reserves of petroleum and gas.We've grown accustomed to this: Russia putting out a version of events that is wildly different from that presented by Ukraine or by Western governments.Moscow wants us to believe that there was no Russian retreat from Snake Island.The statement issued by the Russian Defence Ministry claims that Russian troops there had simply completed "assigned tasks" and left. It also called the departure "a goodwill gesture", to show that Russia wasn't hampering food exports from Ukraine. Considering the strategic importance of Snake Island, which has been fought over for months, and considering, too, the lack of "goodwill gestures" by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine since the invasion, this version of events will convince few outside Russia. Then again, this may be directed more at a domestic audience. The Kremlin wants the Russian public to believe that:This is not just a symbolic victory for Ukraine, it is a strategic success. For Russia this is both a setback and an embarrassing defeat.But it will not substantially change the course of the war. Russia's focus is on conquering the whole of the eastern Donbas and holding on to other areas of the south that it seized at the start of the war. Snake Island may be in a highly strategic part of the Black Sea and in an ideal spot for installing sophisticated missile systems, but ultimately it is still a very small rock.The key question is whether, by forcing the Russians out, the Ukrainians could consider resuming grain exports to reboot their war-ravaged economy. Without an effective navy, there is little chance of that yet, and Russian warships maintain their dominance over the Black Sea. "Practically, you need 10 things to happen before you can safely export grain and this is only one," says Andrew Wilson, professor of Ukrainian studies at University College London. Ukraine has rejected Russian offers to escort grain convoys from Odesa as they would require removing mines from outside the port. Turkey is actively involved in trying to negotiate an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine but the prospect of that happening appear remote at this stage.The next few weeks are seen as pivotal to Ukraine's exports - because the next harvest begins in July.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : US researchers tracked 350,000 people over 10 years to see how well so-called weekend warriors fared. The findings, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, suggest the type and total amount of exercise count, rather than how many sessions.At least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise is recommended. Going for a brisk walk, a light effort cycle on a bike or playing doubles in tennis would count towards this.Or you could do 75 minutes of vigorous activity - something like running, swimming or playing a game of football - say health experts in guidance published by the NHS. Many of the participants in the US study clocked up this amount in a week. But some crammed it into one or two sessions rather than spacing it out. Those who reached their recommended level of activity, whether during the week or the weekend, had lower a death risk than those who did less than the recommend amount.Strength exercises include yoga, pilates and heavy gardening. Very vigorous activity that can help achieve recommended physical activity levels and can be done in shorter, sharper bursts, includes:British Heart Foundation senior cardiac nurse Joanne Whitmore said: "This large study suggests that, when it comes to exercise, it doesn't matter when you do it. "The most important thing is that physical activity is undertaken in the first place."Whether you cram your exercise in on the weekend or spread it across the week, aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week. "Exercise can improve your health, reducing your risk of heart and circulatory diseases like heart attack and stroke."Moderate-intensity activities make you breathe harder and make your heartbeat faster than usual but you should still be able to have a conversation whilst doing them."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The Telegraph's Anita Singh gave five stars to the season's "bitingly funny" first episode, The series, which airs on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK from Monday, follows a dysfunctional media dynasty.Its story hangs on ageing patriarch Logan Roy, played by Scottish actor Brian Cox, and which of his four children will eventually be named his successor.Created by Peep Show's Jesse Armstrong, Succession was named best drama series at last year's Emmys - one of seven awards it received on the night.The show is notable for its spiky, expletive-filled dialogue and its warring cast of characters, which more than one critic has likened to the Murdochs.Two years ago, the second season came to a dramatic climax that saw Jeremy Strong's Kendall Roy unexpectedly turn the tables on his father."There is no shortage of the corporate manoeuverings, jockeyings for position, eyes on chances and arses being covered that we have come to expect of America's most monstrous family company," she went on.The Independent's Philippa Snow concurred, describing the episode as "uproariously funny, painful and delightful"."After a terrible year, full of struggle and calamity and sickness, it is somehow still a pleasure to spend time with some of the worst and most narcissistic people ever written," "Success hasn't spoiled Succession," declared CNN's Brian Lowry, Entertainment Weekly's Kristen Baldwin agreed, Broadcaster Caroline Frost joined the chorus of approval on Radio 4 earlier, telling Today programme listeners that the third season was as "excellent" as its predecessors."I think anybody who comes to this series will find it equally satisfying," she continued, going on to praise the drama's "intimate viciousness".TV critic Boyd Hilton attributed much of the show's success to its "brilliantly written dialogue"."All the characters talk in this incredibly funny, entertaining way," he told Today. "It's spectacularly entertaining just to watch them."Not every critic was in agreement however, with one reviewer suggesting the show now had "constricted ambitions" and felt "snippily familiar"."Maybe it's churlish to complain about a series that's still consistently better written and more refreshingly caustic than anything else on TV," "But for me, Season 3 reveals some wear in a concept that once felt rousingly original."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The 67-year-old was shot dead on Friday while speaking at a campaign event in the southern city of Nara.On Tuesday, a hearse carried the body of the country's longest-serving prime minister through the capital to the funeral hall where he was cremated.A private funeral had been held earlier at the Zojoji temple. Across Tokyo, flags flew at half mast and outside the temple, a long line of mourners stretched over two blocks, many carrying bouquets.The hearse travelled past the headquarters of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) before making its way to the prime minister's residence, where current PM Fumio Kishida and other lawmakers received the motorcade.After that it passed the parliament building, where Abe first entered as a lawmaker in 1993, before arriving at the Kirigaya Funeral Hall. Shinzo Abe's funeral was supposed to be a private affair, closed to all but family and friends. But Japan's public had decided otherwise. From early on Tuesday morning, they began lining up outside the giant Zojoji temple in central Tokyo to lay flowers at the small table set out to one side of the main complex. The weather forecast was heavy thunder showers, but as the funeral service began inside the crowds on the streets outside only grew larger. By 14:30 local time (06:30 GMT) there were tens of thousands of people lining the streets all the way from the Zojoji to the parliament building at Nagatacho.Outside the prime minister's office, as the funeral cortege approached, a hush fell across the crowds and all you could hear was the news helicopters circling above.Mourners bowed to Mrs Abe, sitting in the front of the hearse, holding her husband's funeral tablet. People began to sob loudly. Then some shouted out. "Abe-San, thank you so much."A few seconds later the hearse was gone. A middle-aged woman in the crowd dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. "We will never have another politician like him," she said. Abe was undoubtedly a divisive and controversial figure. His views on the history of World War Two were often troubling. But to the crowds of Japanese who turned out to say goodbye to him, "Abe-San" was just the best prime minister they'd known. Abe was one of Japan's most influential politicians. And his death has sent shockwaves through a nation where incidences of gun violence are extremely rare. Police said the gunman targeted Abe due to grievances he had with a religious group that he believed Abe was a part of. But they are still investigating what the gunman's motives were and whether he acted alone.A vigil held on Monday evening drew hundreds of dignitaries as well as thousands of ordinary Japanese citizens who came to lay flowers. "I came here to offer flowers because I think he gave the Japanese something to be proud about," said Emi Osa. Abe's death drew an outpouring of shock from prominent world leaders, with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemning the shooting as a "despicable attack".US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Kishida to express his "outrage, sadness and deep condolences", and called the assassination "a tragedy for Japan".This video can not be playedWatch: 'It's just so sad' - Mourners attend a vigil for Japan's former PM Shinzo AbeHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedWatch: Sri Lanka opposition leader tells the BBC he is ready to run for presidencyThis comes after his Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party held talks with allies to get support for the move.Sri Lanka is facing an unprecedented economic crisis which has brought thousands to the streets since March. The country has run out of cash and is struggling to import basic items like food, fuel and medicine.President Rajapaksa announced that he plans to resign this week, and the Speaker of parliament has said lawmakers will choose the next president on 20 July. Mr Premadasa told the BBC that his party and allies agreed he should be "putting my nomination for the position of presidency, if a vacancy occurs".He lost the presidential election in 2019, and would need the support of the governing alliance MPs to win.He is banking on getting it due to the popular discontent against Mr Rajapaksa and his family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for more than two decades. The country's inflation rate reached a whopping 55% in June, and millions of people are struggling to make a living. Mr Premadasa said he was ready to take part in an all-party interim government. The SJB leader has been criticised for refusing to take the post of prime minister when it was offered to him in April. His rival Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed - but has also indicated he would resign to make way for a unity government.Mr Premadasa described the current situation in Sri Lanka as "confused, uncertainty and total anarchy", saying it needs "consensus, consultation, compromise and coming togetherness".The country's usable reserves have dropped to around $250m (£210m), according to local media reports.The crippling shortage of fuel has devastated public transport. There are rolling power cuts as power plants lack enough fuel to function. Schools are closed this week as well due to the fuel crisis. Many people are trying to leave the country.Mr Premadasa has conceded that there are no quick fixes.To return the economy to 2019 levels would take approximately four to five years, he said, adding that his party had an economic plan to overcome the crisis. "We are not going to hoodwink the people. We are going to be frank and present a plan to get rid of Sri Lanka's economic ills," Mr Premadasa said. But the protesters at the Galle Face site in Colombo say that all 225 members of parliament are responsible for the current situation, and they want a new beginning with fresh and energetic people in politics.This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on SaturdayHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. "What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss," study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said."It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally," Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.

m_text : This is the day President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has promised to resign after he fled crowds who stormed his palace, but many worry he won't keep his word.A furious public blames him for their worst economic crisis in decades. Sri Lankans are struggling with rolling power cuts and fuel and food shortages.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he would step down once an all-party interim government is set up following Mr Rajapaksa's departure.But many Sri Lankans want him to leave immediately too - because once Mr Rajapaksa departs, under Sri Lanka's constitution, Mr Wickremesinghe would automatically become acting president for 30 days."If they do not go by the 13th [of July], we will restart the protests on a different level," protest organiser Father Jeevantha Peiris told the BBC. "The trade unions and civil rights groups confirm from the 14th onwards they will start a terrible, massive strike along with all the protests." A union leader later confirmed this.Student leader Wasantha Mudalige warned if the two leaders "try to fool the people, we will take drastic actions and it will be much more intense" than the mass protests on Saturday in the capital, Colombo.Thousands had swarmed the presidential palace forcing Mr Rajapaksa, an authoritarian leader whose family has dominated the island's politics for almost two decades, to flee. His whereabouts are currently unclear. Amid uncertainty on the eve of his expected departure, organisers of the Aragalaya protest movement - named after the Sinhalese word for "struggle" - announced a list of demands at a public meeting with political parties and trade unions at Colombo library.Besides demands for the resignations of the two leaders and everyone in their government, they also called for the executive presidency to be abolished, immediate economic relief and a People's Council to advise the government.They also want the country's coffers, which most believe were drained by corruption, to be replenished. How this would be achieved is not clear.Representatives of political parties in parliament were present and said they agreed with the protesters' points, with one lawmaker even saying sorry for allowing the country to slide into economic crisis under their watch. "To my other parliamentarians: we should apologise and rectify the situation, and be accountable to the people," he said as the dozens-strong crowd clapped.But some also warned the protests could not continue indefinitely as the country needed stability. "Aragalaya has to accept whoever comes into power next. You cannot keep protesting," said one representative from the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party.The question of what's next for the movement looms large.This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on SaturdaySince it began in May, it has been driven by ordinary citizens joining forces with a vast array of interest groups - from unionists and farmers to artists, students and socialists - for one single goal: removing Gotabaya Rajapaksa, his brother Mahinda and the rest of their family from power. The president is the only one of these who remains in office.But the protest movement's hydra-headed strength has also proved to be a weakness: it has been largely leaderless with no charismatic figure emerging for people to unite behind. Factions have clashed over the direction of the movement and one dispute between two socialist groups led to a physical fight that left several injured in the capital on Monday night, according to local media reports.It has also meant the protest movement for now cannot offer a contender for the country's leadership once Mr Rajapaksa goes. Deep public suspicion of politicians has meant there is no clear favourite among those in parliament either. Though the But protest organisers the BBC spoke to on Tuesday said they saw the movement remaining as a check on any future government, and were optimistic it could play a role in moving the country out of its current political and economic deadlock."With people power, it's possible," said Father Jeevantha. "The international community and the Sri Lanka diaspora, they are ready to help. People are united and ready to make sacrifices."We have a good moment now with the people's power."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses were hit, leaving seven dead and up to 80 hurt.It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties.Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media.Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak attributed the attack to the US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launcher and spoke of a "reality collision" for the world's "second army". A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing "peaceful cities with American weapons".Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack.Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing.Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now "minus" its ammunition depot.While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line.Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians.The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close.Meanwhile, Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities has claimed further lives. The number killed in Saturday's attack on a five-storey block of flats in the eastern town of Chasiv Yar has risen to 45, including one child, local officials say. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble.The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded.BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats. There were multiple holes in the ground and shrapnel damage at the scene, she said, from what looked like cluster bombs: "People tell me it was the heaviest night of shelling they remember."

m_text : The announcement came just a day after a rare protest in Henan's capital, Zhengzhou, turned violent.Payments will be made in batches from this Friday, local regulators say.The four banks that were the focus of the protests are believed to have frozen a total of 39bn yuan ($5.8bn; £4.9bn) of deposits."Advance payment will be released to customers with a combined amount of less than 50,000 yuan savings in one institution," it said."If the combined amount of a single institution is more than 50,000 yuan, the advance payment will be made successively, and the advance payment arrangement will be announced separately."The regulators asked customers to contact the association from 09:00 local time (02:00 BST) this Friday.However, the announcement has been criticised by some Chinese social media users.One person posted on Weibo: "I'm shocked by shameless Henan government. That's our saving. Why [do we] need your advance payment? We want the right of freedom to save and withdraw our money!""The statement gives no clear clue [of how they are planning to release our savings]. They just don't want to return our money," another said.On Sunday, a protest over the frozen deposits - which was attended by hundreds of people - in Henan's capital, Zhengzhou, turned violent after a clash with a group of unidentified men.The demonstrators said the banks had frozen their deposits because of supposed upgrades to their internal systems in April, but had not communicated with them since then.Local media reports said police were present at the demonstration and had told protesters to leave.Videos on social media showed a group of unidentified men - believed to be security personnel but dressed in plain-clothes - shoving the protesters and throwing water bottles at them.This video can not be playedWATCH: Protesters clash with groups of unidentified men outside of the Zhengzhou People's BankOne protester, who had travelled to Henan for the demonstration, told BBC Chinese about the protestors being attacked."A group of people without police uniforms [on] rushed towards us. They hit us hard, especially [the] men," said the protester, who wanted to be identified only as Ms Wang.Separately on Sunday, local police said that they had arrested "a number of suspects" linked to the case and were making progress in their investigations into the banks, without mentioning the protests.The police said the suspects were believed to have controlled a number of banks in the province through a parent company.In April, the New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, and Yuzhou Xin Min Sheng Village Bank froze their customers' deposits.Since then, thousands of customers have been travelling to Zhengzhou to attempt to withdraw their money.Small protests have erupted, culminating in a large demonstration on 23 May where thousands took to the streets, before police shut it down.Some bank customers who had visited Zhengzhou later How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Jackson Women's Health Organization, the clinic at the heart of the US Supreme Court case that reversed Roe v Wade, stopped giving abortions as a "trigger law" comes into force following the decision.The ruling has left individual states to decide on abortion rights.Battles over bans it triggered are now playing out in courts around the US.In Mississippi, the state ban that has been triggered prohibits abortions at any point of a pregnancy, forcing Jackson Women's Health to stop giving the procedure.On Wednesday, its last day of operations, pro-choice and anti-abortion clashed outside the clinic as it sought to see as many patients as possible before ending its services."It was crazy busy, for obvious reasons," Dr Cheryl Hamlin, who worked at the clinic, told the BBC. "It was definitely a full day, and it was emotional on the way out.""Today is a little bit surreal. I don't even know how I'm feeling right now," she said.Outside the clinic, tensions ran high. Defiant signs were left by volunteers who had helped escort some of the 60 or so patients who came in on the last day for medical and surgical procedures.This video can not be playedInside a US abortion clinic in its final daysDr Hamlin said she was concerned that potential patients may now seek unsafe, unregulated abortions, or continue with potentially high-risk pregnancies that they may have otherwise aborted.Anti-abortion supporters, however, celebrated outside the clinic with music and shouted prayers. Some carried placards that read: "Love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind."The Mississippi "trigger law" was passed in 2007 and written to go into effect ten days after a Supreme Court reversal of Roe v Wade. The law carries penalties of up to 10 years in prison for violations, and provides exceptions only in cases of danger to the life of the mother or rape that has been reported to law enforcement.The law was due to come into effect on Thursday, after a last-minute effort to block it failed.Some 13 states, primarily in the US south and mid-west, had similar laws designed to come into effect after Roe v Wade - which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion - was overturned.At least nine states have instituted a near-total ban, with the only exception being danger to the life of the mother.Other states are now scrambling to protect abortion access amid legal challenges, while clinics are struggling to navigate patchworks of new laws.States where abortion will remain legal are taking measures to protect those travelling from other jurisdictions. For instance, the Democratic governors of Colorado and North Carolina on Wednesday issued executive orders to protect abortion providers and patients from extradition to places that have banned the practice.Meanwhile, one of the largest abortion providers in Texas, Whole Woman's Health, has said it is planning to move its operations to New Mexico, and has started a fundraising effort to help with the costs of moving equipment and supplies.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : A plan to use oral contraceptives to control grey squirrel populations in the UK is making good progress and could soon be put to the test in field trials, say government scientists.The mass birth control plan involves luring grey squirrels into feeding boxes only they can access, using pots containing hazelnut spread. These will be spiked with contraceptives.The project could help eradicate the grey squirrel in the UK without killing them, says environment minister Lord Benyon.It should reduce the "untold damage" grey squirrels do to woodland ecosystems and native red squirrel populations, he says.The government scientists leading the research say the contraceptive, which makes both male and female grey squirrels infertile, should be ready to deploy in the wild within two years.Grey squirrels, first introduced from North America in the late 19th century, damage UK woodlands by stripping bark from trees to get at the nutritious sap beneath.The species has flourished in the UK.  There are now reckoned to be 2.7 million grey squirrels here.The animals target young trees, typically 10-50 years old, and favour broadleaf species including oak, beech, sweet chestnut, and sycamore.They can kill or maim trees, leaving scarring that allows an entry point for other tree pests and diseases which can stunt their growth.The damage they can do threatens the effectiveness of government efforts to tackle climate change by planting tens of thousands of hectares of new woodlands, Grey squirrels have also driven the UK's native red squirrel to the verge of extinction across much of the country.There are thought to be just 160,000 red squirrels left in the UK, with only 15,000 remaining in England.Grey squirrels are significantly larger and stronger than reds and carry a squirrel pox virus that is deadly to reds but to which they are immune. The traditional way of managing the grey squirrel population is by culling them. But grey squirrels breed rapidly and populations can recover quickly.  A century of culling programmes has failed to reduce the population.Dosing the animals with a contraceptive drug is a more humane alternative and will ultimately be more effective, says the lead scientist on the project, Dr Giovanna Massei, from the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).She says her team have developed a vaccine that prompts the immune system to restrict the production of sex hormones, which leaves both male and female squirrels infertile. The drug is not permanent, and further tests are being carried out to find a dose that has a long-lasting effect and is safe to use in the wild.The team have also developed a special feeding hopper with a weighted door designed to keep out species other than squirrels. Trials in Yorkshire and Wales showed 70 per cent of squirrels in each wood visited the bait boxes over a four day period - the only other animals that got in were two particularly enterprising mice.The plan is to bait the hoppers with pots of a hazelnut paste greys find "irresistible" and which will be laced with the new contraceptive.The scientists are also exploring special feeders to be used in areas where there are both red and grey squirrels.  These will be triggered by a plate which weighs the animals and only lets the heavier greys get access to the bait.Dr Massei says computer modelling shows the contraceptive method could bring grey squirrel populations to the brink of extinction in some places."It could even eradicate them from some areas, provided you can do a coordinated control over an area, so they don't start to re-immigrate", Dr Massei says.If the work with grey squirrels is successful Dr Massei believes similar techniques could be used to help control the population of other invasive mammals including rats, mice, deer, and wild boar. The research is being funded by the UK Squirrel Accord (UKSA), a partnership of forestry and conservation organisations. It has raised just over £1m to cover the research and development of the project.The contraceptive scheme is an important additional non-lethal tool for managing grey squirrels, says Kay Haw, the director of the UKSA."Red squirrels now only survive in island ecosystems where there aren't any grey squirrels or where a red squirrel community group are working hard to keep back the grey squirrels", she says.The financial cost of the damage grey squirrels do A mature oak tree can support up to 2,000 other species.The initiative has wide support, including from the Prince of Wales, who was instrumental in the setting up of the UKSA. The animal rights pressure group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says if population control has to be implemented, it backs non-lethal options.But it cautions: "We mustn't forget that grey squirrels and other species deemed "invasive" are where they are through no fault of their own and entirely due to human carelessness, and they deserve to be left in peace."The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham believes a species-specific oral contraceptive could be a "dream ticket" if it proves to be economically viable and practical.He describes the project as "non-violent direct action" to control "a widespread and extremely numerous invasive animal" and suggests an effort should also be made to encourage pine martens back into their previous haunts across the country.These predatory mammals - a native UK species that has suffered historic persecution - How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Jess Daly spent three weeks around the city of Dnipro in June, where she was embedded with the Hospitallers Medical Battalion. She said: "I was based in various towns and villages. There was constant shelling regardless of where the shells were landing and who they were targeting. It was barbaric."She said an ambulance worker who she spent time with last month, Natalia, also known as "Austria", died while taking part in an evacuation."It's very, very dangerous for them. "They're volunteers, they do this out of passion for their people and their country and although they are at constant threat they put their lives on the line regardless."A field hospital she had visited in Avdiivka, near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, has since been destroyed by bombing. Of the 26,000 people who lived there, only 2,000 remained. Jess said she planned to return to the Hospitallers Battalion at the end of November.

m_text : The Gir forest in Gujarat - the only natural habitat of the Asiatic lion - had around 400 lions in 2020, according to a state forest department estimate. The rest of the state has around 275 lions, of which 104 have spread themselves across 300km (186 miles) of Gujarat's coastline. Conservationists say the unusual movement is happening because the natural habitat of lions has become overcrowded."Normally, it is difficult for lions to adapt to a coastal habitat, but they have no option because of scarcity of land," Dr Nishith Dhariya, a wildlife scholar, says.Lions were once widespread across Gujarat, but their numbers shrank to a mere dozen in the early 20th Century, mainly due to hunting and drought.Since then, conservation efforts have helped their population soar in the dry, deciduous Gir forests. But many experts have said for years that the Gir sanctuary has become too small for the territorial animals.  Forest officers say the lions began reaching coastal regions in the 1990s because of territory wars."A lion normally requires a territory of around 100-sq-km (38-sq-mile), and this area also includes three-four lionesses living with their cubs. As the cub grows into an adult, he either takes over the territory from the old lion or leaves the pride to find a new territory," says Shyamal Tikadar, a top state forest official.The lions reach coastal areas because they usually follow the Heran river, which passes through the Gir forest and meets the Arabian sea in Somnath district.  This means that people like Uday Shah - who has a farmhouse by the sea in Veraval district, 80km (50 miles) away from the Gir forest - are now used to seeing lions regularly on the beach."We were scared at first when we saw them, but now they don't bother us," he says.HD Galchar, forest officer of the Veraval range, says a pride of around seven lions has been living near the coast for the past few years. He says the forest department began planting deciduous gum arabic trees in coastal regions when they noticed an uptick in the lion population.Opposite the Veraval sea coast, now there is a thin strip of gum arabic trees and that's where where the pride lives. It gives them a habitat that is somewhat similar to the Gir forest.Mr Galchar says that sometimes, they hunt wild boars and blue bulls (nilgai) in reserved forests around coastal regions.But when they can't find prey, they go to nearby villages and kill goats and cows.Natha Parmar, who has a mango farm near the Heran river in Somnath district, says lions have killed at least 10 of his calves in the past few years.He and other villagers were furious at first. But then they realised that there was an unexpected benefit."Earlier, we had to deal with herds of wild boar and blue bulls as they would damage all our crops. Now that has almost stopped," he says.He and other farmers are now learning to live cautiously and respectfully with the lions. It helps that the lions haven't attacked any humans in the area until now."When we run into lions, we either stop and make way for them or change our route without disturbing them," he says.Jheenabai, who tracks lions in coastal areas regularly for the forest department, says people in the region are changing their way of life to adapt to lions, much like the humans around Gir did earlier."Sometimes, the lions move out to nearby forests or residential areas to hunt, but then they come back here to rest. They have adapted to this habitat," he claims.Lions in Gujarat have adapted to habitat changes according to circumstances, says wildlife expert Rajan Joshi. They had become used to living near humans in Gir, he says, and later, in open fields as the numbers grew.This video can not be playedThis lion in India’s Gujarat state had to get surgery on both eyes.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : She warns their silence is often misleading. "Children can be traumatised by horrific videos they see online," says the head teacher who has 180 pupils aged from four-and-a-half to eleven in her care.Ms Wetton says she sees children as young as six playing 12-rated computer games online. "We've had cases of children needing medication to sleep. This is immensely worrying".Some children coming in to school are inattentive in class because they've been up all night, playing on devices like tablets or phones. One recent craze was to see who in a WhatsApp group could stay up the longest - the winner sent a message at 04:00.As well as watching inappropriate content online, or staying up too late, children who are online unsupervised can be vulnerable to paedophiles. These issues are familiar to Rachel O'Connell. She has investigated online child abuse, working on statistical techniques to identify  abusers.In the course of her research she went online posing as an eight-year-old child who hadn't made friends at school. Her understanding of the mindset of predators is extensive and chilling, for example, she says that friendless children are often a target: "They look for that," she explains.Ms O'Connell visits schools and finds many parents have no idea which apps their children can access. "Putting naked selfies online seems to be a rite of passage now," she says. "Parents feel they don't know how to 'digitally' parent, they can feel helpless. We need oversight." One significant problem is that children can be targeted while browsing sites that are theoretically off limits for young people.So, preventing children from getting access to any of these sites would help tackle the problem.The business founded by Ms O'Connell, TrustElevate, is based on the principle of Zero Data - establishing whether a child should be allowed to log onto a service but without giving away any personal details about that child. Ms O'Connell has been trialling Zero Data techniques with mobile phone operator, EE. She wants to create a family access app that will screen users for their age and seek parental approval. TrustElevate software generates a token containing just the child's age range and no personal information, this information allows a service provider to check out a potential new user. While the service provider can block access, if the details don't tally with the permissions held on the system, the token cannot be exploited to push other services, or products, to the child. These types of technical tools are a help, but schools are fighting back as well.At JH Godwin School, Ms Wetton runs online safety workshops, where parents are invited to bring a laptop along so they can download safety apps and parental controls.To her frustration, engagement from parents is not a given. She has arranged workshops where just one parent turned up out of 150 who have children at the school. Ms Wetton has even tried a tactical approach, putting online safety talks ahead of popular events, such as the Christmas, or Easter bingo sessions. However, she has had heckles from people who felt they shouldn't be lectured on their evening out. So, the school is left to come up with practical measures to shield its children from malicious online contact.For example, she suggests not wearing a school branded jumper while on TikTok. "If children do that, then anyone watching knows where they are going to be at 0800 and 1600."She believes online safety apps should be frontloaded on to any device a child might use. "Surely, that's better than waiting for a mental health pandemic in the very young? Plus, computer games can be addictive. If we don't protect them, we get exhausted children coming here, and it's like trying to teach an empty vessel that just won't fill." She wants to see tech companies made to feel responsible for safeguarding, through measures like age verification software. And TrustElevate's Ms O'Connell, says the government should be doing a lot more to regulate children's access to games and websites."There's no oversight into that at the moment, no oversight into the impact of it."A UK government Online Harms White Paper published in 2019, reported that 12-15 year olds spend over 20 hours a week online. And regulator, Ofcom, states that 79% of that group had experienced at least one potentially harmful experience online in the previous year. The Online Safety Bill, currently before Parliament, will introduce a duty to protect children from harmful, or inappropriate material. The Bill does not stipulate which technology tools should be used to do this, but Ofcom may respond to failures to protect children by recommending the use of age verification systems.Speaking to BBC News, Chris Philp, Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy, lays out what he believes will be a much stricter operating environment for online platforms in the future. "If platforms want children to use their services, they will need to protect them from accessing content that is harmful or inappropriate. If their services are meant for adults, they will need to prevent underage access."He insists that schools and parents wrestling with online dangers will be assisted by rigorous government measures. "Those who fail to comply, will face massive fines and risk their services being blocked from access in the UK." At JH Godwin School tougher protection measures would be warmly welcomed. Ms Wetton describes the gulf between how big tech presents its role in society as positive and the unintended consequences in the real world."Live streaming services are supposed to bring 'like-minded people' together, but in reality it means predators using search terms such as 'girls dancing'."She knows the techniques paedophiles use, such as matching their "pace" to their intended victims. "These people are patient and work on a child, so we must open their eyes [to potential dangers]."

m_text : Customers must now pay £1.99 to return products, with the cost deducted from their refund. The move, Boohoo blamed the move on the rising cost of shipping.High Street firms such as Uniqlo, Next and Zara already charge for online returns.Online shopping boomed in the pandemic, but customers are more likely to return items bought online than in store, raising costs for retailers.Analysts said other retailers were likely to follow suit in charging for returns."Shoppers have had an easy ride, but that's changing now - they will increasingly find there's a price to pay for returns," said Catherine Shuttleworth, retail expert and founder of Savvy Marketing."The costs, both financially and environmentally, have been stacking up for retailers... So retailers have been tightening up their returns policy by reducing the number of days a shopper can keep an item before expecting a return and in some cases charging a return fee," she added."We can expect to see this trend continuing and [now] we've seen Boohoo quietly introduce it. If you buy something for £10 at Boohoo, it's a real disincentive to return it if you lose £2, 20% of your investment to send it back."Online shopping gained a lot of ground during the pandemic, with a big increase in the number of items being sent back.For fashion retailers, returns can be costly. Not only do retailers often cover the costs of online returns as a way of winning customers from rivals, but it also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock.Many shoppers are also becoming more aware of the environmental impact of deliveries and returns.In May, Boohoo said soaring returns were It said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate higher than it was before the pandemic.Boohoo's brands include BoohooMan, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams.A spokesperson from Boohoo said: "As the cost of shipping has increased, we've had to look at where we can adapt without compromising what our customers love most, the convenience of shopping with us and the great value that our brands offer."This has meant that we will be applying a charge of £1.99 to returns so that we can continue to offer great prices and products and do this in a more sustainable way."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : On arrival at Kenya's biggest seaport, Mombasa, the container is loaded onto a ship for a voyage to Europe of around 30 days. Despite their lengthy journey, they will still be sold to European shoppers with a vase-life of about a week.So, how is this possible?"The flowers will be kept at a temperature of 0.5 degrees celsius throughout the journey," says Elizabeth Kimani, the manager of quality and standards at Sian Flowers.As well as controlling the temperature, the atmosphere system in the container reduces the oxygen level from 20% to 4%, while increasing the carbon dioxide level from 0.4% to 4%. This technology is all part of the elaborate process of preserving the blooms for as long as possible. "Through this [system] you stop all activity in the flowers that, as a result, go into dormancy," Ms Kimani says, explaining that the flowers are put to sleep.A sophisticated tracking system allows staff from the shipping company to monitor the temperature, oxygen and CO2 levels throughout the journey.But flowers destined for such a long voyage need extra attention to prepare them, as soon as they are picked."We harvest them early in the morning, when it's still cool and they will be the first to go into the cold room," explains Linda Murungi from grower, Sian Flowers.Freshly-harvested roses, for instance, are then dipped into a chemical mixture to protect them from the fungus, botrytis.After that, the stems are put into buckets to absorb a hydration solution so they can survive the thirty days without water. They are also put in a solution that curbs the growth hormone, ethylene, which causes the ageing of the flowers.Once that process is completed, the flowers are then packed into cartons with holes in the top and bottom, which allow air from the container's system to circulate.Kenya has become one of the world's biggest flower exporters thanks to its equatorial location, high altitudes and relatively cheap labour, it competes for dominance in the market with Colombia and Ecuador.For years, the two Latin American countries have been exporting about 10% of their flowers by sea freight to North America and Europe.As these flowers are at sea for a much shorter period of time, firms exporting from Latin America do not use controlled atmosphere, or post-harvest treatments. Kenyan exporters however, have to be extra-careful. There is no direct shipping route in to Europe, instead, containers are transferred in the Middle East from smaller vessels to much larger ones."All processes around sea freight require extreme precision - there's no room for shortcuts," says Jeroen van der Hulst, chief executive at consulting company, FlowerWatch. "One mistake and your flowers might arrive as compost in Europe." The Kenyan flowers' complex journey involves a higher risk of delay, as containers occasionally miss their transfer window.The port of Mombasa has also been known for delays and bureaucracy. Another challenge is it also lacks a so-called 'green line' for perishable products - flowers have to queue up with all the other containers.Due to these challenges, Kenya's flower farmers have, in the past, been wary of sea freight preferring to transport their flowers by air but shifted during the pandemic.The farmers saw the price of air freight soar from around $1.80 per kilo, in January 2020, to around $2.80 per kilo in June 2022, according to Harm-Jan Mostert commercial manager for Africa at Royal FloraHolland, the Dutch company behind the world's biggest flower auction.The transport situation became so difficult that some growers even resorted to destroying parts of their harvest. "Only this year, more than three hundred containers with ten tons of flowers each have been exported from Kenya by sea", Mr Van der Hulst says. "That's a substantial saving of thirty full cargo aircrafts."In addition to being cheaper, using sea freight can cut carbon emissions by between 84% and 95% respectively, Although, clearly if you are worried about the carbon footprint of cut flowers, then it's probably best to buy a seasonal bouquet grown closer to home.Walking through his green house in Naivasha, Robin Letcher from Royal De Ruiter East Africa, explains to BBC News that rose breeders are also trying to develop new varieties.Pointing at some red roses he says: "This variety, for example, has firmer petals that are less sensitive to botrytis [fungus], which is good for sea freight."In the future, this could potentially reduce the need for chemicals during post-harvest treatments, although it could take seven to ten years to develop successfully so, "is something for the longer term", he adds.Many flower producers remain nervous about switching over to sea freight."A stupid mistake, a port strike or bad weather at sea can really get you in trouble with sea freight," Mr Letcher explains.Last year, for example, a container accidentally went to Singapore. "It [eventually] arrived in the Netherlands after 53 days. So, all the flowers had to be destroyed, which was a disaster for the producers," he says.Growers also need to contend with the perception in the industry that flowers sent by sea freight have a shorter shelf life, particularly at the world's largest flower auction in the Netherlands.Customers do not notice much of a difference, according to Ms Kimani who says the sea freight blooms are indistinguishable from air freight flowers, adding that some of their roses even travel better by sea, than by air. "Although air freight only takes around 12 hours, we sometimes witness enormous temperature peaks during the journey...which obviously has a negative influence on the flowers," she explains. "With sea freight, however, our flowers are continuously in dormancy."The logistics of moving these flowers is not a simple decision, as prices are constantly changing. Shipping prices have also been rising closer to air freight costs.But in the longer term, Mr Moster forecasts sea freight will account for at least 20% of Kenyan flower exports - a sector worth  $934m per year."Air freight prices probably will never fall back to the level of before the Covid-19 crisis, so also from a cost perspective sea freight remains interesting," Mr Moster says.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The firm Lego said it would now end its partnership with Inventive Retail Group which runs 81 shops on Lego's behalf. It did not mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pulling out of Russia.A spokeswoman for Lego said: "When the Lego Group stopped shipments to Russia in early March, we also ceased all commercial activity and put almost all our employees on extended leave."The company said it was cutting most of its Moscow-based team and has "provided 70 employees with financial packages to support them as they look for new opportunities".  Lego is one of a handful of Western brands that remained in Russia after other major companies shut their sites following the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine which was launched on 24 February.Some companies sold their products through franchisees in Russia and had to unwind complex partnerships with third party firms. McDonald's announced in May that it would close its sites in Russia which were later sold to a local company. The restaurants were "de-arched" and rebranded "Tasty and that's it".Unlike a number of companies who have condemned Russia, Lego has decided not to directly comment on the country's actions. In March, Lego said: "Our thoughts are with all the children and families suffering as a result of the war in Ukraine."A few years ago, the Danish company provoked a backlash when it emerged that it refused to sell a bulk order of its plastic bricks to the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Ai had used Lego to create portraits of dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, such as Nelson Mandela, in the US and had planned a similar exhibition in Australia. However, he said Lego had told the museum in Melbourne its bricks could not be used for art containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements".The decision was widely condemned and In the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of Western firms which initially suspended business in Russia are now deciding to pull out altogether.US sportswear giant Nike and coffee chain Starbucks have both now retreated entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March.Car firm Renault has also sold its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow.Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus.Other well-known firms such as L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder both said they would close shops and stop online sales but have not announced plans to permanently withdraw.Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn, so some firms have been reluctant to burn bridges.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : India has previously made efforts to extradite the former billionaire, who is believed to still be in London.He made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand before branching out into aviation and Formula 1 racing.Kingfisher Airlines was India's second largest domestic carrier before it collapsed a decade ago.On Monday, India's Supreme Court found Mr Mallya guilty of contempt, as it said he failed to disclose his assets after defaulting on a loan.He was found guilty of the same offence in 2017 for allegedly transferring $40m to his children, even as loans to Kingfisher Airlines remained unpaid, Known as the "king of good times", in a reference to his lavish lifestyle, Mr Mallya has fought extradition from the UK to India, where he faces charges including fraud.Mr Mallya who left India in 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (£842m), has denied fleeing the country.Late in 2018, a court in London ruled that he could be extradited from the UK to India In 2020, Mr Mallya lost his final appeal against his extradition at the High Court in London. However, he is still believed to be living in London.Mr Mallya faces a number of charges related to alleged financial irregularities at Kingfisher Airlines.The carrier was wound down in 2012 amid reports that pilots and cabin crew had worked unpaid for 15 months.This video can not be playedIPL: India police arrest organisers of fake cricket matchHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : But German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume.He has accused the Kremlin of using gas "as a weapon" in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine.Mr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas.He described that as "a grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can".He said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year.In mid-June Russia's state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline's capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy.The Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow "to the whims of Russia".Canada says it is granting Siemens Canada a "time-limited and revocable permit" to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions.Germany's government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently.Pipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on.The pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia's Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days.The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now.Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme.Austria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline.Visiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Last year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia.The government has also given the go-ahead for Germany's first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven.Another undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war.If Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating.A leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that "if Nord Stream 1 doesn't come back on at all, let's say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level"."That would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas.  So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU," he told the BBC.Germany's gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports. Industry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany's gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics.German households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.

m_text : Their town, Lismore, was caught in the catastrophic floods that submerged southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in February and March. Those floods have become the The latest flooding to hit Australia Back in February, perched on a hill the Sprogis family home was safe, but the couple were worried about their downtown physiotherapy business. It was purposely located on the second floor but even that was not enough.From the water-height charts they could tell the office was going to be inundated, but it was too late to save anything, the authorities had already issued an evacuation order."We could have put things up higher at that time, had we known, but we didn't," says Mr Sprogis, who had been at his practice the night before."I even left my new laptop on the office desk, thinking, well, [the water has] never been in here before so it won't come in." By the following day, his practice was 1.8m underwater, files, records and equipment all damaged or lost.Meanwhile in New South Wales in Gibberagee, children's book author Candy Lawrence watched as 2,000 copies of her books were sucked into the deluge.Ms Lawrence had been carefully watching government flood warnings and gathering supplies, anticipating that nearby roads would be cut off, as often happened when the area flooded.But, like Mr Sprogis, she was not expecting water to sweep through her property and that of her neighbours, some of whom had to scramble onto their roof to escape the fast-rising floodwaters."I feel like the world is pretty much ending, so why bother educating children?," she says, referencing her destroyed book collection and the terrifying new weather patterns.Like thousands of others caught in the disaster, Mr Sprogis and Ms Lawrence would have liked more warning. So why wasn't there a better system, which could alert them in real-time if their properties were in danger?Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer specialising in hydrology and flooding asked this question after watching her friend's house in Brisbane flood over the roof peak in 2011. The question came up again after she moved to Calgary, Canada, and witnessed a similarly devastating flood in 2013.Ms Murphy knew that during the Brisbane and Calgary floods, hydrology forecasts had predicted where rivers would peak at certain bridges, but she realised it wasn't enough. "If you aren't a hydraulic engineer [who is able] to translate that flood height into an impact to properties - your personal property, your car - it can be very challenging," she says. Ms Murphy also notes that static flood maps - including those that chart one-in-100-year floods - are also expensive, and can take days, or weeks, to produce. This makes them more suited to development planning and infrastructure design applications, rather than emergency planning and management."I was thinking, there has to be something more," says Ms Murphy. She began dedicating her evenings and weekends to looking for a solution, which eventually led her to co-found FloodMapp with web developer, Ryan Prosser.With a significant research and development investment, FloodMapp was launched in 2018.FloodMapp's technology can rapidly forecast water levels to map floods before they happen. It does this by ingesting huge amounts of historical data (including things like rainfall and ground saturation levels) and uses artificial intelligence to accurately model the way water will behave.The software also uses information about land features and river systems to work out how a flood will affect different areas. The company claims its models can run 100,000 times faster than traditional techniques.An added benefit is that the resulting models can refresh hourly using real-time river sensor data and rainfall forecasts.The technology is not available to individuals, instead it is being integrated into services offered by government agencies in Australia and the US, to better understand floods before, during and after they happen. Researchers at the University of Melbourne's Department of Infrastructure Engineering are taking a similar approach, understanding that speed is key for emergency planning.Like Ms Murphy, flood modeller turned researcher, Dr Wenyan Wu, is looking at ways to simulate flood levels over time, at speed, using machine learning techniques. Importantly, this is being done Dr Wu says without compromising accuracy and without costing the earth.The availability of accurate real-time data that can be interpreted at a property-specific level is a huge part of the challenge, but being able to disseminate meaningful data to the public is also key. As Dr Wu says, "If people's collective comprehension [of flood risk] doesn't improve, you will not actually improve the situation."Even the concept of a one-in-100-year flood is widely misunderstood. (It means a flood event has a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, as opposed to there only being one major flood every 100 years.)That's where companies like the Australian-based Early Warning Network (EWN) come in. EWN sends opt-in SMS (text messages), email, landline and app push alerts to residents and businesses in at-risk areas, typically via insurers, councils and other government agencies who have signed up to their services. Flood alerts are primarily based on data collected and distributed by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.However, as operations manager Michael Bath explains, EWN has a 24/7 team of human severe weather forecasters (all of whom have an understanding of threats from their experience as storm chasers). This team assess the warnings, eliminate duplication, and send geo-targeted alerts, using custom-made software.This ensures people receive clear and localised information."If you've ever had automated warnings from weather agencies before, [you'll know] they can be very repetitive," says Mr Bath. "If you automatically send that to residents, they just get really annoyed with it and tune out."  Mr Bath, Dr Wu and Ms Murphy all agree that ultimately governments need to adopt these systems and technologies, and make planning decisions about whether future development should be permitted on floodplains and whether buy-back schemes are warranted in high-risk areas.However, in many cases, moving entire communities or renovating properties at scale using flood-resistant materials is not practical in the immediate future, given these measures require significant funding and political will."We need something today, right now, because we are living on floodplains, and emergency warnings and alerts fill a critical role to improve safety, to save lives and prevent damage," says Ms Murphy. "We have to work together to build a safer future."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The fierce and protracted battle that had been predicted for Lysychansk was avoided, according to the regional governor, by a strategic withdrawal. Serhiy Haidai told me: "Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed it from a distance, so there was no point in staying."That does seem to tally with Russian accounts of the capture of the city, seemingly moving in unopposed. Videos posted on social media on Sunday show Chechen fighters dancing in the central districts. And well they might celebrate. The capture of Lysychansk means that Russia has essentially taken the entire Luhansk region, a key strategic aim of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine.So, what does it mean both for the battle for the Donbas, but also the wider war?Let's start from the Ukrainian perspective. For them, the crucial thing was to avoid an encirclement, as was seen in Mariupol. Although their defence of the southern port city did slow the Russian advance by many weeks, the end result was the killing or capture of thousands of the most capable soldiers in the Ukrainian army. Ukraine wanted to avoid that at all costs. In his nightly address, President Zelensky stated this explicitly. "We will rebuild the walls, we will regain the land, but people must be saved above all else," he told the nation.Serhiy Haidai made exactly the same point, telling me: "Our troops have retreated to more fortified positions… We held the defence of Luhansk for five months. While that defence was holding, we were building new fortifications in the Donetsk region. Now the troops have gone there." Writing a few hours after the fall of Lysychansk, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych even went as far as calling the defence of Lysychansk-Severodonetsk "a successful military operation".Given that the Russian flag now flies above both cities, that logic may seem a little perverse, but his point is that they were playing a long game, buying valuable time. To understand this logic, you need to understand the importance of Western weapons to Ukraine's resistance. In short, without Nato supplies they would be in even greater trouble than they currently are. The longer they can delay the Russian advance, the more advanced rocket and artillery systems they can bring to the fight. US-provided HIMARS, already in action, are said to radically alter the balance of the conflict. More time means more supplies, which in turn tips the scales in their favour, especially given that sanctions mean Russia is struggling to replace its spent hardware and ammunition.Now for the Russian perspective. Their stated aim is the capture, they say "liberation", of the Donbas. Taking Luhansk brings that one step closer. Indeed, its significance was highlighted by President Putin today, when he made the commanders of the offensive "Heroes of Russia", the Federation's highest possible award. But what next? It seems almost certain that they will push on to try to take the rest of the Donbas, especially the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled in recent days. Sloviansk is said to hold particular significance to the separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their forces if - when - they take the Donbas.President Putin tacitly acknowledged this today, saying: "The units that took part in active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities."If they are still making rapid advances they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond.If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the "special military operation", Russia's euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry it could be that the frontline becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest.For now, none of this is certain, with both sides claiming they have the upper hand. Indeed, it is worth noting that while Ukraine is on the back foot in the Donbas, they have had recent successes, most notably retaking Snake Island, where today the blue and yellow flag was once again raised.The only thing of which we can be sure - this war will not be over any time soon, with the people of the Donetsk region set to be the next to suffer its consequences.

m_text : The announcement came just a day after a rare protest in Henan's capital, Zhengzhou, turned violent.Payments will be made in batches from this Friday, local regulators say.The four banks that were the focus of the protests are believed to have frozen a total of 39bn yuan ($5.8bn; £4.9bn) of deposits."Advance payment will be released to customers with a combined amount of less than 50,000 yuan savings in one institution," it said."If the combined amount of a single institution is more than 50,000 yuan, the advance payment will be made successively, and the advance payment arrangement will be announced separately."The regulators asked customers to contact the association from 09:00 local time (02:00 BST) this Friday.However, the announcement has been criticised by some Chinese social media users.One person posted on Weibo: "I'm shocked by shameless Henan government. That's our saving. Why [do we] need your advance payment? We want the right of freedom to save and withdraw our money!""The statement gives no clear clue [of how they are planning to release our savings]. They just don't want to return our money," another said.On Sunday, a protest over the frozen deposits - which was attended by hundreds of people - in Henan's capital, Zhengzhou, turned violent after a clash with a group of unidentified men.The demonstrators said the banks had frozen their deposits because of supposed upgrades to their internal systems in April, but had not communicated with them since then.Local media reports said police were present at the demonstration and had told protesters to leave.Videos on social media showed a group of unidentified men - believed to be security personnel but dressed in plain-clothes - shoving the protesters and throwing water bottles at them.This video can not be playedWATCH: Protesters clash with groups of unidentified men outside of the Zhengzhou People's BankOne protester, who had travelled to Henan for the demonstration, told BBC Chinese about the protestors being attacked."A group of people without police uniforms [on] rushed towards us. They hit us hard, especially [the] men," said the protester, who wanted to be identified only as Ms Wang.Separately on Sunday, local police said that they had arrested "a number of suspects" linked to the case and were making progress in their investigations into the banks, without mentioning the protests.The police said the suspects were believed to have controlled a number of banks in the province through a parent company.In April, the New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, and Yuzhou Xin Min Sheng Village Bank froze their customers' deposits.Since then, thousands of customers have been travelling to Zhengzhou to attempt to withdraw their money.Small protests have erupted, culminating in a large demonstration on 23 May where thousands took to the streets, before police shut it down.Some bank customers who had visited Zhengzhou later How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Ukraine's military said it had destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in the city of Nova Kakhovka, killing dozens of soldiers.However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses storing fertiliser were hit, leaving five dead and up to 80 wounded. It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties.Reports from both sides indicate a US-made Himars rocket system was used in the attack. Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media.Elsewhere in southern Ukraine, the city of Mykolaiv has been hit by what residents say is the worst Russian shelling they can remember. BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city, as well as nearby flats.Our correspondent says there is evidence that cluster munitions were used.Officials said a school and homes were also hit, while at least four people were injured. The region's governor, Vitaliy Kim, accused Russia of carrying out the strikes in revenge for attacks on Russian ammunition depots and for commanders who he said had been killed by Ukrainian forces. In another development, 45 people, including one child, are now known to have died after Russian rockets struck an apartment block in Chasiv Yar, a town in eastern Ukraine, on Saturday night.The attack was one of the deadliest so far in the war.Iran plans to supply Russia with potentially hundreds of drones for its war in Ukraine, some with combat capabilities, a US official has said.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said information the US had suggested Iran was preparing to train Russian forces to use the drones.He added that it was unclear whether Iran had delivered them yet.Iran said technological co-operation with Russia preceded the war, without confirming or denying the US claim.Drones have played an integral part in the war for both Ukraine and Russia.Just last week, Both sides are using them to spot the enemy's positions and then help direct and correct their own artillery fire on a target. A petition in Ukraine calling for same-sex marriage to be legalised has gained enough signatures for the president to consider the proposal.The petition has more than 28,000 signatures, meaning President Volodymyr Zelensky now has 10 days to respond.Homosexuality is not illegal in Ukraine, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised.This has caused particular problems for LGBT people signing up for the military following Russia's invasion.Under Ukrainian law, if someone in a same-sex relationship dies their partner cannot collect their body or bury them.Lego, the Danish toymaking giant, has said it will stop operating in Russia indefinitely because of "continued extensive disruption".The firm Lego said it would now end its partnership with Inventive Retail Group, which runs 81 shops on Lego's behalf. It did not mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pulling out of Russia.A spokeswoman for Lego said: "When the Lego Group stopped shipments to Russia in early March, we also ceased all commercial activity and put almost all our employees on extended leave."The firm said it was cutting most of its Moscow-based team and had "provided 70 employees with financial packages to support them as they look for new opportunities".  Lego is one of a handful of Western brands that remained in Russia after other major companies shut their sites in the wake of the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine.Russian military equipment captured by the Ukrainian armed forces has gone on display in the Czech capital, Prague.The display of war trophies, which includes a damaged T-90 tank, Buk air defence system and Msta howitzer, was unveiled on Letna Plain, a large open space a short distance from Prague Castle."This exhibition proves how vital support from partner countries is to us," Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky told the BBC via email after launching the exhibit."Russian propaganda likes to scare people that their tanks could reach Prague, Berlin or Paris. Ukrainians demonstrate - only in the form of scrap," he said.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : "At ten past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building."I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. "Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."Russia accuses In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion."This is the first time something like this has happened in the city," Lidiya tells me. "There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater.Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine; some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling."We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to," Lidiya tells me. "So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here." Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory. "Russia needs to give a proper response to this, so that there is no more shelling and so they stop scaring our people," says Vadim. We're talking near the police cordon. "Firing a missile back at Kyiv would have made them think." Knarik tells me she "feels sorry" for people in Ukraine. "They're the same as us. They have children, too. But I think we need to take harsher measures."  So many people here do not join the dots; they don't make the connection between Russia invading Ukraine and their lives becoming less safe. That's partly because the Russian state media does all it can to prevent those dots from being joined together in people's minds. It does so by demonising Ukrainians: referring to them as "Nazis", "neo-Nazis", "fascists" and "ultra-nationalists", and by repeating from morning till night that in this conflict Russia has justice on its side.But, also, many Russians simply don't want to believe that their country started this, that Russia could possibly be the aggressor.Now, though, a senior figure in the Russian Orthodox Church has spoken out for peace. Following the explosion in Belgorod, Metropolitan Ioann of Belgorod and Stary Oskol said it was time "to turn swords into ploughshares".On the website of the Belgorod Diocese, he wrote: "We humbly pray that the deceased find peace and that the injured heal. We pray for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which has today come to our homes too."Lidiya agrees."We need to restore good relations in a peaceful way," she tells me. "We need to come to our senses."This video can not be playedWatch: BBC journalist Olga Malchevska returns to bombed Kyiv home for the first timeHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a "climate catastrophe". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to "phase down" rather than "phase out" coal after a late intervention by China and India. The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed.While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the "start of a breakthrough", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.However, no firm dates have been set.A flurry of other announcements were made:The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - This is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiatives A Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.Financial organisations controlling $130tn The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming "well below" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.COP stands for "Conference of the Parties", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : For 1,000 years, pilgrims have headed to Fécamp abbey in Normandy to worship the "Precious Blood of Christ" relics.Six weeks later, a Dutch art sleuth has described how the relics were handed over to him in an elaborate operation.Arthur Brand says he will now give them to police to return them to the abbey."Seven to eight per cent of stolen art is returned and much of it is destroyed. In this case, I think the thief had no idea what it was," he told the BBC.The relics were stolen late at night on 1 June from the sacristy at Fécamp, north-east of the port of Le Havre. The thief is believed to have been locked in the building overnight and there was little security at the time.The relics contained two lead vials which, according to legend, were thrown into the sea in a trunk and washed ashore at Fécamp. As well as the lead bulbs, a number of liturgical dishes and other objects were stolen.Mr Brand, who is widely known for his work in tracking down stolen art and artefacts, described how he was contacted by email by someone who revealed the relics had been stored at the home of a friend of the thief. When the friend realised what it was, he then passed it on to the person who emailed the Dutch art detective, who suggested that they leave it on his doorstep and ring the doorbell.Returning it direct to the abbey ran the risk of arrest, Mr Brand explained.Le Havre Bishop Jean-Luc Brunin said at the time that it was an unbearable attack on people's faith and part of a tradition that stretched back to the 12th Century. The theft took place less than two weeks before an annual Mass celebrating the "Precious blood" relic."A couple of days later, at 10:30 in the evening, the doorbell rang. I looked from my balcony outside and in the dark I saw a box. I ran down the stairs, afraid that someone would take the box. Outside I looked around, but there was no-one there," said Mr Brand.As a Catholic himself, he said he could not believe the beauty of the relics, describing the moment he opened the box containing them as an "authentic, religious experience". He said he would hand the relics over to Dutch police on Tuesday and they would be responsible for returning them to the abbey at Fécamp.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy.Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind. The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive.Finland gets most of its gas from Russia, so the war in Ukraine has drawn the issue of green power into sharp focus. It has the longest Russian border in the EU and Moscow has Concerns over sources of heat and light, especially with the long, cold Finnish winter on the horizon are preoccupying politicians and citizens alike. But in a corner of a small power plant in western Finland stands a new piece of technology that has the potential to ease some of these worries. The key element in this device? Around 100 tonnes of builder's sand, piled high inside a dull grey silo.These rough and ready grains may well represent a simple, cost-effective way of storing power for when it's needed most. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production.But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. The toughest question is about intermittency - how do you keep the lights on when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow?Adding more renewables to the electricity grid also means you need to boost other energy sources to balance the network, as too much or too little power can cause it to collapse. The most obvious answer to these problems is large scale batteries which can store and balance energy demands as the grid becomes greener. Right now, But in the town of Kankaanpää, a team of young Finnish engineers have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand that they believe can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way. "Whenever there's like this high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly," said Markku Ylönen, one of the two founders of The device has been installed in the Vatajankoski power plant which runs the district heating system for the area. Low-cost electricity warms the sand up to 500C by resistive heating (the same process that makes electric fires work). This generates hot air which is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger. Sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time. The developers say that their device could keep sand at 500C for several months. So when energy prices are higher, the battery discharges the hot air which warms water for the district heating system which is then pumped around homes, offices and even the local swimming pool.The idea for the sand battery was first developed at a former pulp mill in the city of Tampere, with the council donating the work space and providing funding to get it off the ground. "If we have some power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it's the coldest, it's going to be extremely expensive," said Elina Seppänen, an energy and climate specialist for the city."But if we have this sort of solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense, I think."One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference - and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat? The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid. But storing green energy as heat for the longer term is also a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that's used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels.Other research groups, such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory But the Finns are the first with a working, commercial system, that so far is performing well, according to the man who's invested in the system."It's really simple, but we liked the idea of trying something new, to be the first in the world to do something like this," said Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant. "It's a bit crazy, if you wish, but I think it's going to be a success."Follow Matt on Twitter How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

Speaking to BBC journalist Nick Raikes, he said: "I never thought it would be something that I would get".According to the UK Health Security Agency, there have been more than 1,000 cases of monkeypox identified in the UK since the start of May.The majority of people infected have been men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men, with most living in London. Ahead of London Pride the city's public health director, Prof Kevin Fenton, has advised those with monkeypox symptoms such as blisters, fevers, swollen glands, to stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.Monkeypox is spread through close contact, such as touching skin or sharing bedding with someone who has monkeypox or has monkeypox symptoms.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : It is becoming a discovery machine like no other.Stars, asteroids and distant, bright galaxies - anything that can be visibly pinpointed is having its vital statistics measured by the observatory.Gaia has already mapped the positions of nearly two billion objects. Now, it can reveal more about their make-up."Essentially, previously, we could say very precisely where they are; now we can say what they are," Prof Nick Walton, from Cambridge University and a member of the Gaia science team, told BBC News.The European Space Agency's (Esa) Gaia satellite was launched in 2013 and placed a million miles from Earth. It looks a bit like a spinning top hat. And as it rotates, the telescope uses its This is especially important when trying to measure distances to objects, which Gaia achieves by tracking how these targets wobble ever so slightly on the sky as it circles the Sun - a neat form of trigonometry that has now been practised on 1.8 billion stars in, or very near, our Milky Way galaxy. The new data dump reveals spectroscopy information as well.Spectroscopy slices the light coming from stars into its constituent colours, to reveal the chemistry, temperature, mass, age and velocity of the targets under study.And for an important subset of stars - some 33 million - it has allowed Gaia scientists to determine how quickly these objects are moving towards or away from Earth. Combined with their previously established movement across the sky, this means we now have their full three-dimensional behaviour. Such information will give researchers even keener insights on how the Milky Way galaxy is structured and is evolving - from the past, into the future.And with some of these 3D stars also mapped in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, we should have a better idea of how and precisely when its mass will merge with the Milky Way - something expected in the next few billion years.One of the most surprising discoveries coming out of the new data is the recognition that Gaia can do so-called asteroseismology. This is the study of stars' subtle surface resonances, which enable scientists to pull out information such as how big a star is and how old it is."Starquakes teach us a lot about stars, notably their internal workings. Gaia is opening a goldmine for asteroseismology of massive stars," said Prof Conny Aerts from Belgium's KU Leuven.  Whenever Gaia drops its latest dataset (and this is the third full release), it is immediately mined by astronomy groups around the world.Some of these teams have scholarly papers ready to publish and just need Gaia's numbers to complete their projects. For competing groups, it will be a race to see who can publish first.  Hot topics will include the search for high-velocity stars, which move at hundreds of kilometres per second. "The most likely scenario for how these stars are getting such high velocities is that they must have been close to our galactic centre, which has the physics to produce these accelerations," Esa's Gaia project scientist Dr Timo Prusti said. "So far, these stars have been more like candidates, because the Gaia accuracy has not been sufficient [to fully understand them], but I'm sure astronomers will be ready with their queries to attack the new Gaia data."Other hot topics ready to be mined include whether stars are enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, or depleted. The low "metallicity" stars are the more fascinating because they are probably very old, perhaps in the first group that came together to form the Milky Way.The Gaia telescope mission may have launched just over eight years ago but Monday's data release represents only the first 34 months of its science operations. A further five years of gathered data has yet to be fully processed. And with Gaia expected to keep scanning the sky until 2025, it could be the end of the decade or even the early 2030s before all of its information is put in the public domain."What do you get from that extra time? Well, it bashes down uncertainties for one thing. But the main advantage is in increasing your sensitivity to things that are changing," Prof Gerry Gilmore, from Cambridge University, told BBC News."In particular, this is true for the oscillations of stars that tell us there are planets moving around them. "If you've only got one year of data, you can only find planets that are very, very close to their stars. "But after 10 years of observations, you will find planets far from their parent star, indeed families of planets."By the end of its mission, Gaia could have identified tens of thousands of planets in the Milky Way.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled.The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September.Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations.Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up.Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement."While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart," said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel."Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines."A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take "a couple of days" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed.Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff.In addition, a temporary government "amnesty" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty.But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner."Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations," said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye."Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000."The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move."To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline," Mr Walsh told Reuters."I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."He added: "Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable.The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions.The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers.Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers.But some airline people tell a very different story.They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of "terrible mismanagement".It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately "lowballed" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines.Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer.Heathrow's But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures.Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move."But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."Virgin Atlantic said it "stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"."However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport."Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : "This is a story that comes around every time a tank gets knocked out," says David Willey, curator and instructor at the Tank Museum at Bovington, Dorset, which boasts the world's largest collection of tanks. "Because the tank is such a symbol of power, when it's defeated people jump to the conclusion it's the end of the tank."We are watching a Soviet-designed T-72 main battle tank rev its engine and clatter towards the refuelling point before rehearsing for a demonstration. This is basically the same tank model that rolled across the border into Ukraine in February and destroyed in their hundreds by small, agile bands of well-trained Ukrainian infantry wielding drones, Javelin and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons (Nlaws). "It's important not to draw the wrong lessons from what we have witnessed over the past several months," says retired US Army Lt Gen Ben Hodges, who until recently commanded US land forces in Europe.  "The Russian tanks in question were typically poorly employed, unsupported by dismounted infantry, and without the benefit of a strong non-commissioned officer (NCO) corps, such as one finds in the US Army or British Army. Therefore, they were all easy kills for the defending Ukrainian forces."His views are echoed by retired British Army Brigadier Ben Barry, now senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. "The defeat of the Russian attack on Kyiv shows what happens when tanks are inexpertly deployed by a force that cannot do combined arms warfare (combining tanks with infantry, artillery and aircraft) and has weak logistics. "A competent Nato battle group would push out infantry to stop tanks being ambushed."The tank - one of the iconic symbols of modern warfare - has both its critics and defenders. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Armenia's tanks got decimated by Azerbaijan's Turkish-made drones. In Libya, these same drones, the TB2 Bayraktar, inflicted serious losses on the forces of General Haftar, while in Syria, government tanks also fell prey to the Turkish drones. In the early phase of the Ukraine war, modern anti-tank guided missiles, supplied by Britain, the US and other nations, proved to be a game-changer in driving back the Russian armoured columns from north of the capital, Kyiv. Meanwhile, in the second phase, in the Donbas, massed Russian artillery has been the game-changer, using destructive firepower to slowly blast its way forward.So far this year, Russia is estimated to have lost more than 700 tanks - some destroyed, some abandoned. These tanks are often pictured covered in reactive armour - which looks like a large rectangular box. It is designed to set off a small explosion as the missile hits, blunting its effect. But Western-supplied drones and anti-tank missiles have got around this, mainly by hitting the tank from above on the turret, where the armour is thinnest."This war has been the day of the drone," says Brig Barry. "It tells us that you need drones for defence to keep enemy drones off your back. You need classic low-level air defence including lasers and electronic jamming."Something that may prolong the future of the tank is the Active Protection System (APS). It is a way to head off whatever is attacking your tank before it hits you. "There are two types of APS, soft and hard kill evasion suites," explains Bovington's David Willey. He pauses while the nearby T72 tank, a gift from the Polish Army, belches blue exhaust fumes and swivels its massive 125mm gun menacingly in our direction. "Soft kill means electronic pulses that can disrupt the incoming missile. Hard kill means firing something kinetic at it, like a stream of bullets." As is so often the case, the Israeli military have researched this area exhaustively, especially since 2006 when their tanks took a beating from Hezbollah's IED's and skilfully deployed anti-tank missiles in south Lebanon. They developed an Active Protection System called Trophy. It works by using radar to track the incoming threat - missile or drone - then a rotating launcher on the turret fires a stream of explosive projectiles, neutralising it before it can hit the tank. Trophy, or a variant of it, is likely to become standard on many of the latest Western tanks."Advances in counter-drone measures will reduce the effectiveness of drones that now seem to roam about the battlefield looking for easy targets," says Gen Hodges.So, does the tank have a future? Or is it, as some predict, doomed for the scrapyard?"There will always be a need for protected mobile firepower," says Gen Hodges. He predicts a future, not far off, where remote-controlled, unmanned tanks - essentially armoured drones - will be moving across the battlefield in tandem with crewed tanks, increasing their firepower while reducing the risk to life. "I was an Infantry soldier and I'd never want to be in any fight in any terrain without the benefit of protected, mobile firepower," he says.Justin Crump, a former British Army tank commander and now CEO of the defence intelligence firm Sibylline, agrees. "Tanks have a firepower, mobility and resilience that Infantry just don't have. It's a flexible platform that can operate day and night, get to the objective and deliver shock to the enemy. Ukraine would not be rebuilding its tank forces if tanks were not vital. They have asked for over twice the number of tanks that the UK possesses." David Willey has been instructing the British Army and more recently, visiting Ukrainian soldiers. "It's not the best tank that counts, it's the best crew," he says.

m_text : But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  The These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Niño.For many years, groups of so-called climate "sceptics" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  A key UN report released in 2021 said it "is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".

m_text : The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled.The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September.Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations.Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up.Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement."While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart," said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel."Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines."A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take "a couple of days" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed.Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff.In addition, a temporary government "amnesty" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty.But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner."Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations," said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye."Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000."The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move."To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline," Mr Walsh told Reuters."I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."He added: "Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable.The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions.The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers.Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers.But some airline people tell a very different story.They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of "terrible mismanagement".It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately "lowballed" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines.Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer.Heathrow's But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures.Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move."But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."Virgin Atlantic said it "stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"."However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport."Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : The country has seen nothing like it since the death of Emperor Hirohito in 1989. Abe, the country's longest serving post-war prime minister, inspired respect rather than love. In fact, opinion polls repeatedly showed that most Japanese weren't overly fond of him, even though they kept voting for him. So what is behind their grief? It's partly driven by shock at the way he died - gunned down while delivering a speech at a campaign event. There's an inability to comprehend that such an outrageous death could take place in Japan, where gun crimes and political violence are so rare. But with his death, there is also a growing realisation of what Abe gave Japan. First and foremost, that was stability and security.Before Abe returned to power in 2012, Japan had just suffered its biggest trauma since World War Two - a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. The governing coalition was in chaos. The Japanese economy had still not recovered from its 1992 stock market collapse, and over the previous two decades, Japan had seen 14 prime ministers come and go. One of them lasted just 64 days. Abe swept back into office with a real sense of energy, and most importantly, an economic plan that he conveniently dubbed "Abenomics". He declared "Japan is back". He announced a "big bazooka" of cash that would flood the financial markets with liquidity and force prices upwards even as interest rates were dropped below zero. As prices rose, and with nowhere to put their cash, people were compelled to spend, creating growth, and pushing up wages. Did "Abenomics" work? Not really. But the stock market soared, employment picked up and the man in the prime minister's office appeared to know what he was doing.  Economics was actually never Abe's strong suit. His lifelong obsession was national security. And that's where his true legacy lies. Abe sought to build an alliance of what he called "like-minded democracies", including India and Australia. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Quad, an alliance between the US, Japan, India and Australia. But the key to Japan's security policy is "Article 9" - in Japan, everybody knows what you mean when you say the words. It's a crucial part of the constitution that makes Japan a "pacifist nation". It was put there by the victorious Americans after World War Two, and Japanese nationalists have been railing against it ever since. They claim it makes Japan weak, unable to stand up for itself or defend its allies. In a post-Cold War world, with the threat from China and North Korea rising, Abe was determined that Article 9 had to go. "The idea of the constitution was that Japan should rely on the goodwill of the world for its security," says Kazuhiko Togo, a former senior diplomat and friend of Abe.  "It's nonsense. So, Abe wanted to get out from this fallacy," he adds.  But how? Changing Japan's constitution is extremely hard. It needs a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, and the support of a national referendum. Abe knew that was all but impossible. So, he came up with another solution - he would pass a law "re-interpreting" the meaning of Article 9. To Mr Togo that was a stroke of genius."He changed the interpretation of Article 9, so that if the United States is attacking in the vicinity of Japan then it's as if Japan is attacked, and that would allow us to assert our right to collective self-defence. The implication is huge," he explains.That is, if the United States enters a war to, let's say, defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, Japan can join as well. Abe's critics agree that the implications are huge, but they also see them as troubling. "I think Mr Abe's argument [about Article 9] would have been more convincing if he had the courage and honesty to do it from the front door rather than doing everything through the back door," says Professor Koichi Nakano, a political scientist."It's like Article 9 was thrown out of the window without having even been formally discussed and formally amended." Even Abe's supporters admit his was an incomplete legacy. But after Sunday's election, his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may now be in a position to push through the constitutional change he had always sought. The governing coalition led by LDP already had a two-thirds majority in the lower house. And it slightly increased its majority in the upper house in polls held two days after Abe's killing. But more importantly, a right-wing party, Ishin no Kai, has significantly upped its share of seats in the upper house. While it's not a coalition partner, it supports constitutional revision and would therefore vote in favour of it. That vote would cement Abe's legacy.In some ways, Abe was ahead of his time. Since he stepped down in 2020 for health reasons, Russia has invaded Ukraine and China's intentions towards Taiwan have become ever clearer. Japan is now concerned both at China's increasingly aggressive and frequent intrusions in to Japanese-controlled waters around the Senkaku islands (which China also claims), and Beijing's air and naval activity around Taiwan. Taiwan's northern coast is only 100km south of Japan's southernmost sea border. So Japan is also aware of the possibility that any conflict over Taiwan would inevitably draw in the United States - and due to the large US military bases in Japan, effect Japan directly as well. All of this has led to a shift in Japanese public opinion - a majority of the people now support an increase in defence spending. Perhaps it is finally time for Japan to have that honest conversation about Article 9.

m_text : Getting to the bottom of this story involved four years of painstaking detective work. Crucial to this was a cache of internal emails from within the headquarters of UK Special Forces (UKSF) - the military directorate that oversees the SAS. These contained a handful of details about previously classified deadly raids that senior UKSF officers had considered suspicious back in 2011. At the time, British troops were still fighting the Taliban alongside allies in Afghanistan.We were able to see these emails because they were included in court documents from a judicial review into a night raid We knew from sources within the Royal Military Police (RMP) that investigators believed that suspect killings were far more widespread than the three incidents featured in our initial programme.But all we had to go on from the court documents were around a dozen dates of when the raids took place, and sometimes the number of people killed. We had no way of identifying where they had occurred from the documents alone.RMP investigators had been prevented by armed forces headquarters from visiting the sites in question. Our RMP sources also told us a lack of co-operation from UKSF prevented them from interviewing senior Special Forces officers and that they suspected pressure had been exerted from on high when they were ordered not to view potentially crucial aerial footage of the operations.The Ministry of Defence spokesman said that British forces "served with courage and professionalism in Afghanistan" and were always held to the "highest standards". The MoD said it could not comment on specific allegations, but that declining to comment should not be taken as acceptance of the allegations' factual accuracy.Then we had a breakthrough. A source - who must remain anonymous - handed us hundreds of contemporaneous military reports. They didn't disclose the precise location of the raids, but they did offer potentially vital clues about what had happened during each one. We trawled through hundreds of these operational accounts.Then we spent months trying to work out where they had taken place. To do this, we scoured press cuttings looking for incidents that might match those in the court documents - our colleagues in BBC Monitoring had archived and translated local language news coverage from 2011.Panorama was also given access to a leaked US military log. Combing through that, we looked for events that might match a British night raid. We spoke to journalists who had covered the conflict, including incredibly brave local reporters, as well as soldiers and other British officials in Afghanistan. Together, this gave Panorama enough to travel to Afghanistan and speak to witnesses, who would give their evidence for the first time.The US military log had given us a map grid reference that led us to the village of Nad Ali, in Helmand province. There the Panorama team met Haji Habibullah - a charismatic, bear-like man in his 70s whose neighbours treated him like an elder.But his demeanour changed when he described the killing of his two young sons aged 16 and 20. Remembering what happened to them, Habibullah broke down and wept.In the early hours of 7 February 2011, Habibullah's sons, Samiullah and Nisar Ahmad, had been sleeping in a single-room guesthouse in the grounds of the family home. Alongside them were seven mourners who had come to the village for a funeral. Then four helicopters carrying SAS personnel landed in the nearby fields - and soon, all nine people in the guesthouse were dead.According to the official SAS account of the incident, they had believed the property was linked to a Taliban leader. As the troops entered the compound, the SAS said, several insurgents opened fire - so the SAS then shot back, killing those in the guesthouse. The report adds that three AK-47 rifles were recovered in the raid.But that wasn't how Habibullah remembered it. All those who died had been unarmed civilians, he said, unconnected to the Taliban. He took the BBC team to the guesthouse. It had been bricked up - the memory of his sons' deaths had made it too painful to use again. "When I remember them it hurts me so much," Habibullah said. Panorama examined the guesthouse, measuring and photographing marks on the walls. Fragments of what appeared to be bullets were still present, embedded in the wall. All but one set of bullet holes were in clusters less than 75cm from the floor.After returning from Afghanistan, Panorama showed the photographs and measurements to an expert in UKSF weaponry, who said multiple rounds appeared to have been fired from above - which suggested the men had been shot while they were lying down or sitting against the wall, and not in a firefight. We also discovered that several years after the shootings, RMP investigators had viewed photographs of the scene, taken in the immediate aftermath, and drawn the same conclusion. British special forces killed hundreds of people on night raids in Afghanistan, but were some of the shootings executions? BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton uncovers new evidence and tracks down eyewitnesses.One military police officer told us they also thought the low height of the bullet marks in the wall significantly undermined the SAS's version of events. But because of the obstruction they faced from others within the military and the Ministry of Defence, the RMP had felt they stood little chance of prosecuting anyone for murder. In its statement, the MoD said: "No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light."Moreover, Habibullah described how all nine men had been shot cleanly to the head or chest - a common characteristic of a deliberate SAS shooting at close range.The raid was also suspiciously similar to another SAS operation we had looked at in our 2019 investigation, in which everyone inside a guesthouse had been killed, including a 12 and 14 year old boy, with clusters of bullet holes left close to the floor. And indeed, it appeared that guesthouses were specifically targeted - a source who served with the SAS in Afghanistan told us it became an unofficial "policy" to kill everyone they encountered inside one, whether they were armed or not.  It is notable that while nine people - suspected insurgents, according to the SAS - were killed in the Nad Ali raid, only three guns were recovered in the SAS's version of events. Habibullah's insistence that those who died were not armed raised the possibility of the use of so-called "drop weapons" - planted to make it appear that defenceless people had been armed when they were killed.We spoke to people who had served with the SAS squadron who confirmed they had witnessed AK-47s  being planted in this way. In the immediate aftermath of the Nad Ali incident, there were suspicions that something had gone terribly wrong. Back at Special Forces HQ in London, in a secret memo, a senior officer had shared concerns with the head of UK Special Forces.Another 2011 raid that matched one of the dates in the UKSF documents caught our attention. A small mention of civilian casualties in a local newspaper article helped us find it.Two days after the incident in Nad Ali, eight people were killed by the same unit during a raid on a home in the village of Khanano, in Musa Qala, towards the very north of Helmand. This time seven were shot dead in a guesthouse, and a further detainee was later killed inside the main house.The similarities with previous incidents were striking. Again, everyone in a guesthouse had been killed and, according to the SAS, fewer AK47s were recovered than the number of people shot dead.According to the SAS's operational account, an insurgent fired at the SAS as they approached and was killed. In the guesthouse they found four dead bodies, plus two armed men who were apparently responsible. These supposed insurgents were then shot and killed by the SAS, their official version of events said.Then, it continued, the other inhabitants of the house surrendered and were rounded up - and when another man was taken inside the main building to assist with the search, he picked up a concealed rifle and aimed it at the soldiers, so he too was shot dead. But people within UKSF told Panorama the SAS's account of the raid described a very unlikely set of events. We had learned from military police sources that the RMP had been concerned that blood patterns and other details in photos taken at the scene were not consistent with what the SAS claimed had taken place. We discovered senior UKSF officers had remarked in emails sent the following day that the incident was suspiciously similar to several other operations in which an Afghan man had been taken into a property after surrendering to the SAS, then supposedly grabbed a weapon and was shot before he could open fire.Panorama travelled to the scene and met Mohammad Daud, 43, a quiet, unassuming man who remembered the events of that night in stark detail. Daud told us two of his brothers - Mohammad Tahir, who was 15, and Abdul Zahir, 25 - had been killed along with five others staying in the guesthouse.Daud said that after the killings, he had discovered that two of the dead men may have been linked to the Taliban. He said they were strangers who had shown up on their doorstep asking for shelter - it's a common Afghan custom to offer travellers a room.    But the family strongly denied that any of those who died had been armed or that they had fired on the SAS. According to Daud and his family, all seven men in the guesthouse were found lying dead inside the room. This does not tally with the SAS unit's own account that the first person killed by the SAS had been outdoors, threatening troops with an AK rifle. The military police had also been concerned about this inconsistency.The report had said four men in the guesthouse were killed by insurgents, who were then in turn killed by the SAS. But the family described how all the men had been shot cleanly to the head or chest - as in the Nad Ali raid - which would be unusual in a firefight. The SAS had also claimed the insurgents had been positioned behind the dead men when they fired. But the family said all had gunshot wounds to the front of their bodies.Additionally, the family told us how the bullets had passed through most of the bodies into the bedding and the floor beneath them. Again, this looked like a series of close-range Special Forces killings from above.Daud showed us the guesthouse. It showed no obvious signs of indiscriminate or accidental firing. There were, however, bullet holes in the door and in the wall behind it. From the position the body of Daud's brother Mohammad Tahir was found in, they believe he was trying to open the door from the inside when he was shot. After the shootings in the guesthouse, Daud said, the SAS then moved on to the main building, where they summoned everyone into the courtyard.According to Daud and others present, the troops then checked their names against a list and asked his brother Ahmad Shah go back inside and open a curtain. Soon shots rang out and Ahmad Shah was dead. Ahmad Shah shared his name with the suspected leader of a Taliban bomb-making cell. Perhaps the troops were unaware, but it is a common name in Afghanistan. Daud and his family believe the carnage at their home was a result of mistaken identity. As we kept digging, we uncovered further incidents that followed the same pattern and matched the details of the operations that had caused so much concern among UKSF officers.An operation in Sangin on 12 March 2011 resulted in the deaths of eight members of the same family. The SAS's account stated its troops were attacked with small arms fire and a grenade. However, when the Panorama team went to visit the scene, the family denied that there had been any weapons in their home. They said each of the men killed were shot five or six times "on their foreheads, mouth and on the face". A low bullet mark on the wall of the guesthouse again suggested one of those killed may have been lying down when he was shot dead. Haji Sadiquallah told Panorama how his son and nephew were handcuffed, taken back inside separate rooms and shot dead. "There was no AK-47, no grenade, no machine gun or any other weapon in our house," he said. "They just say that to exonerate themselves. They say that to hide their violence - to legitimise what they did. It is a complete lie."All in all, our evidence painted a disturbing picture - one that suggested war crimes had been committed by British Special Forces and that these had been covered up for years.Before we left him Habibullah took Panorama's team to visit the graves of his sons. These were simple graves, decorated with flags and colourful scraps of material, close to the family home. Habibullah said a prayer beside them and then fell silent.In a further statement today, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to "unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already been fully investigated".It said: "We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan."Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute. Insinuating otherwise is irresponsible, incorrect and puts our brave Armed Forces personnel at risk both in the field and reputationally."The Ministry of Defence of course stands open to considering any new evidence, there would be no obstruction. But in the absence of this, we strongly object to this subjective reporting."© 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

m_text : The spacecraft has just detected a Magnitude 5 tremor - the biggest event yet in its three years of operation on the Red Planet.But InSight is now picking up very little energy through its solar panels.Dust covers the arrays, and winter is approaching.Lower light levels will signal the end of the mission.Equipment, such as the probe's robotic arm, is about to be locked in position and turned off.The all-important seismometer can be put in a reduced working mode for a while, coming on for only part of a Martian day, or Sol, and then perhaps only every other day. Mission managers will keep this up for as long as they can, but they know time is not on their side."[In July] we anticipate our seismometer to be turned off, not because we want to turn it off but unfortunately we don't have the energy to run it," said Kathya Zamora Garcia, InSight's deputy project manager at the US space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California."At the end of the calendar year, we do anticipate having to conclude all InSight operations," she told reporters.The mission, which landed in a flat landscape known as Elysium Planitia in 2018, has transformed our understanding of the interior of the Red Planet.Before its sophisticated French-UK seismometer package began returning data, we had a "really fuzzy picture" of how Mars' different layers were organised.Now, after using the vibrations from more than 1,300 Marsquakes to "image" the planet's deep geology, scientists can be much more certain about the thickness and composition of the planet's crust, mantle and core."What InSight has done is shone a light on the inside of Mars," said principal investigator Bruce Banerdt, also from JPL."Whereas we know a lot about the outside of Mars - we've taken images, we've taken spectra, we've made measurements of the surface of Mars for the last 50 years - InSight's been the first mission to shine a light beneath the surface of Mars and show us what the rest of the planet looks like."Scientists knew that at some point Martian dust would settle on InSight's solar wings to block out the Sun's rays. It's the perennial blight against which all solar-panelled missions to the Red Planet must battle.When InSight touched down on 26 November 2018, its black-coloured, sparkling clear wings were producing about 5,000 Watt hours per sol. Today, coloured red from all the dust, they can produce only one-tenth as much at approximately 500 Watt hours per sol."We use an electric oven as a marker to get people to understand," said Zamora Garcia. "So, when we first landed, it was about an hour, 40 minutes or so where we could run an electric oven. Nowadays, we could probably run that for approximately 10 minutes max."Ingenious efforts have been made to try to clean the wings. InSight has a scoop and by sprinkling dust on to the wings, it had the effect of knocking off some of the dust already in place. The trick has been used successfully six times to extend operations, but it won't save the mission.Scientists will hope InSight can add a few more events to its tally of 1,313 detected Marsquakes. Who knows, they may even get to see another Magnitude 5 before everything on the mission shuts down.The M5 was detected on the Martian morning of 4 May. For context, a tremor of that scale here on Earth would definitely be noticed and might even cause some minor damage to loosely constructed buildings. Mission team-members are still analysing the data but they think the Marsquake occurred close to, but not exactly in, a region of the planet called Cerberus Fossae. Cerberus Fossae, which is about 1,500km to the east of InSight's location, has been the source for all of the bigger tremors witnessed by the probe. The terrain there is heavily faulted as a result of past volcanic activity on Mars. Two huge parallel fissures run across the landscape for 1,000km.The vast majority of quakes on Mars likely stem from thermal anomalies in the crust. As the planet cools and shrinks, its rocks will break along lines of weakness, releasing the seismic waves InSight's seismometer was designed to pick up."InSight has been an incredible mission for us, and it's given us a glimpse of Mars that we couldn't get from any other spacecraft in our Nasa Mars fleet," said Lori Glaze, the director of Nasa’s planetary science division."Understanding Mars and studying Mars' interior structure answers key questions about the early formation of the rocky planets in our inner Solar System, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Earth's Moon, and Mars, as well as helping us understand rocky [planets beyond our Solar System]."

m_text : Western powers bowed to a demand from Russia, a staunch ally of the Syrian government, which vetoed their proposal for a one-year extension last week.The mandate for deliveries via Turkey expired on Sunday, prompting the UN aid chief to warn that "people will die".Some 800 lorries cross into the north-western province of Idlib every month with aid for 2.4 million civilians.Almost double that number of people, mostly women and children, are trapped in the last stronghold of the jihadist and Turkish-backed rebel groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad after 11 years of brutal conflict.An estimated 70% of the civilians already do not have enough to eat at a time when food prices are continuing to rise sharply and one in three children are undernourished, according to the UN.More than 1.7 million internally displaced people are also having to live in dire conditions in tented camps and informal settlements with limited access to water, sanitation and healthcare.The region also regularly sees deadly clashes, air strikes and shelling despite a ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey in 2020 to halt a government assault.More than 56,000 lorries carrying food, medicine, shelters and other live-saving aid have gone into areas of Syria outside the government's control since 2014, when the Security Council authorised the UN's first such cross-border humanitarian operation.In 2020, Russia and China used their veto powers as permanent council members to stop UN deliveries via Jordan and Iraq, as well as one of the two Turkish border points. They argued that the operation violated Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that the aid should cross the front lines via government-controlled territory. That move meant people living in the Kurdish-controlled north-eastern Syria had to start relying on shipments via Damascus and left the Bab al-Hawa crossing as the UN's only option to access Idlib.On Friday, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution drafted by Ireland and Norway that would have extended authorisation for deliveries via Bab al-Hawa for another year, while the US, UK and France blocked a Russian proposal for a six-month renewal.She warned that a six-month extension "could leave Syrians without blankets in the dead of winter" and would deny the UN its partners the time to organise the reliable supply of aid. "There's no need to fight and you know it perfectly well!" Diplomats failed to agree a compromise before the mandate for the operation expired on Sunday night, despite Western powers eventually bowed to Russia's demand for a six-month extension of deliveries through the Bab al-Hawa crossing until January 2023, after Mr Polyanskiy continued to insist that anything else would be vetoed.Russia, China and 10 other countries voted in favour of the resolution on Tuesday, while the US, UK and France abstained to register their anger.Ms Thomas-Greenfield claimed afterwards that the aid operation's mandate had been "held hostage" by Russia."When I spoke to UN experts and NGOs over the weekend, they told us that a temporary extension is, of course, better than nothing. So we did not block this resolution, even though it falls far short of the Security Council's duty to the Syrian people," she added.In a separate development in north-west Syria on Tuesday, A US Central Command statement said Agal was "responsible for aggressively pursuing the development of [IS] networks outside of Iraq and Syria" and that his removal would disrupt the group's ability to carry out global attacks.It added that a senior IS official closely associated Agal with was seriously injured in the strike, which targeted a motorbike near Jindayris on Tuesday. First responders from the White Helmets said two people had been killed.This video can not be playedTwo children, a decade of war in Syria: Rahaf and Mustafa symbolise the suffering inflicted by Syria's warHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The 6.5m (21ft 3in)-tall cast shows four Asiatic lions mounted back-to-back on a circular disc.But the new statue, adapted from an ancient Indian sculpture dating back to 250BC, has raised many eyebrows.Critics say the lions have been given a makeover and the new "ferocious" look strays from their original depiction.Mr Modi shared a video of the unveiling on Monday morning that showed the cast - weighing 9,500kg (20,943 pounds) - on top of the central foyer of the new parliament building.A senior government official said the installation of India's national emblem - adapted from the Lion Capital of Ashoka, a sculpture that was atop one of the several pillars erected by Emperor Ashoka during his reign in 250BC - was an "important milestone in the decolonisation" of the capital city.But many social media users pointed out that the demeanour of the lions in the new cast differed significantly from the original depiction and that instead of looking "benevolent and regal", they now "snarled".The new parliament building - which is still under construction - is part of the government's 200bn-rupee ($2.7bn; £2bn) plan to modernise old colonial government buildings in Delhi. Opposition parties have criticised the government for the cost of the project and its aesthetics.On Monday, Sitaram Yechury, a leader of the opposition Communist Party of India (Marxist), Mr Yechury also criticised the prime minister for performing a puja - Hindu religious ceremony - at the event. Opposition parties also said that The new parliament building was expected to be completed by August 2022 in time for the country's celebrations of 75 years of independence. But officials later said the building would be complete only in October.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Ukraine's military said it had destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in the city of Nova Kakhovka, killing dozens of soldiers.However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses storing fertiliser were hit, leaving five dead and up to 80 wounded. It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties.Reports from both sides indicate a US-made Himars rocket system was used in the attack. Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media.Elsewhere in southern Ukraine, the city of Mykolaiv has been hit by what residents say is the worst Russian shelling they can remember. BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city, as well as nearby flats.Our correspondent says there is evidence that cluster munitions were used.Officials said a school and homes were also hit, while at least four people were injured. The region's governor, Vitaliy Kim, accused Russia of carrying out the strikes in revenge for attacks on Russian ammunition depots and for commanders who he said had been killed by Ukrainian forces. In another development, 45 people, including one child, are now known to have died after Russian rockets struck an apartment block in Chasiv Yar, a town in eastern Ukraine, on Saturday night.The attack was one of the deadliest so far in the war.Iran plans to supply Russia with potentially hundreds of drones for its war in Ukraine, some with combat capabilities, a US official has said.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said information the US had suggested Iran was preparing to train Russian forces to use the drones.He added that it was unclear whether Iran had delivered them yet.Iran said technological co-operation with Russia preceded the war, without confirming or denying the US claim.Drones have played an integral part in the war for both Ukraine and Russia.Just last week, Both sides are using them to spot the enemy's positions and then help direct and correct their own artillery fire on a target. A petition in Ukraine calling for same-sex marriage to be legalised has gained enough signatures for the president to consider the proposal.The petition has more than 28,000 signatures, meaning President Volodymyr Zelensky now has 10 days to respond.Homosexuality is not illegal in Ukraine, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised.This has caused particular problems for LGBT people signing up for the military following Russia's invasion.Under Ukrainian law, if someone in a same-sex relationship dies their partner cannot collect their body or bury them.Lego, the Danish toymaking giant, has said it will stop operating in Russia indefinitely because of "continued extensive disruption".The firm Lego said it would now end its partnership with Inventive Retail Group, which runs 81 shops on Lego's behalf. It did not mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pulling out of Russia.A spokeswoman for Lego said: "When the Lego Group stopped shipments to Russia in early March, we also ceased all commercial activity and put almost all our employees on extended leave."The firm said it was cutting most of its Moscow-based team and had "provided 70 employees with financial packages to support them as they look for new opportunities".  Lego is one of a handful of Western brands that remained in Russia after other major companies shut their sites in the wake of the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine.Russian military equipment captured by the Ukrainian armed forces has gone on display in the Czech capital, Prague.The display of war trophies, which includes a damaged T-90 tank, Buk air defence system and Msta howitzer, was unveiled on Letna Plain, a large open space a short distance from Prague Castle."This exhibition proves how vital support from partner countries is to us," Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky told the BBC via email after launching the exhibit."Russian propaganda likes to scare people that their tanks could reach Prague, Berlin or Paris. Ukrainians demonstrate - only in the form of scrap," he said.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : For 1,000 years, pilgrims have headed to Fécamp abbey in Normandy to worship the "Precious Blood of Christ" relics.Six weeks later, a Dutch art sleuth has described how the relics were handed over to him in an elaborate operation.Arthur Brand says he will now give them to police to return them to the abbey."Seven to eight per cent of stolen art is returned and much of it is destroyed. In this case, I think the thief had no idea what it was," he told the BBC.The relics were stolen late at night on 1 June from the sacristy at Fécamp, north-east of the port of Le Havre. The thief is believed to have been locked in the building overnight and there was little security at the time.The relics contained two lead vials which, according to legend, were thrown into the sea in a trunk and washed ashore at Fécamp. As well as the lead bulbs, a number of liturgical dishes and other objects were stolen.Mr Brand, who is widely known for his work in tracking down stolen art and artefacts, described how he was contacted by email by someone who revealed the relics had been stored at the home of a friend of the thief. When the friend realised what it was, he then passed it on to the person who emailed the Dutch art detective, who suggested that they leave it on his doorstep and ring the doorbell.Returning it direct to the abbey ran the risk of arrest, Mr Brand explained.Le Havre Bishop Jean-Luc Brunin said at the time that it was an unbearable attack on people's faith and part of a tradition that stretched back to the 12th Century. The theft took place less than two weeks before an annual Mass celebrating the "Precious blood" relic."A couple of days later, at 10:30 in the evening, the doorbell rang. I looked from my balcony outside and in the dark I saw a box. I ran down the stairs, afraid that someone would take the box. Outside I looked around, but there was no-one there," said Mr Brand.As a Catholic himself, he said he could not believe the beauty of the relics, describing the moment he opened the box containing them as an "authentic, religious experience". He said he would hand the relics over to Dutch police on Tuesday and they would be responsible for returning them to the abbey at Fécamp.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the information the US had suggested Iran was preparing to train Russian forces to use the drones.He added that it was unclear whether Iran had delivered them yet.Iran said technological co-operation with Russia preceded the war, without confirming or denying the US claim."There has been no special development in this relationship recently," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani Chafi was quoted as saying by Iran's Fars news agency.Drones have played an integral part in the war for both Ukraine and Russia.Just last week, Both sides are using them to spot the enemy's positions and then help direct and correct their own artillery fire on a target. The Kremlin has said Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Iran's capital, Tehran, on 19 July. He is expected to meet Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan for peace talks on Syria.This video can not be playedWatch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops (March 2022 report)Mr Sullivan added that intelligence received by the US supported the view that Russia's assault on eastern Ukraine was "coming at a cost to the sustainment of its own weapons".He also observed that Iranian drones had previously been used by Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack Saudi Arabia.His comments came ahead of US President Joe Biden's visit to Israel and Saudi Arabia this week. Neither country has so far joined sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine.Israel sees Iran, which calls for its elimination, as its biggest regional threat.The US and other allies have supplied billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Ukraine since the invasion in February.

Russia's latest advance follows the recent capture of the nearby town of Severodonetsk.The territory mapped below by the Institute for the Study of War was accurate as of information from 3 July.President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk "thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons".Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the "complete liberation" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion.Following the capture of Lysychansk and the Luhansk region, "Russia's focus will now almost certainly switch to capturing [the region of] Donetsk" according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).Further west, Ukrainian forces are continuing to hold back Russian attacks towards Slovyansk from the direction of Izyum, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).Russian forces have suffered heavy losses since the invasion began.The MoD says Russia is likely to have suffered devastating losses among its middle and junior ranking officers. It says these losses are likely to contribute to a loss of morale and poor discipline among lower ranks.Significant quantities of Russian weaponry have also been destroyed.As a result, Russia has tried to combine some heavily depleted units, forming what some analysts have called 'Frankenstein forces' to fight in the east.Further north, Russian units are vying for control of positions north of Kharkiv and attempting to protect ground lines of communication to the Donbas, according to the ISW.Ukrainian military officials have stated that they intend to use the US-provided Himars rocket artillery systems in the area to target these lines of communication.Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.But strong resistance from Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv in the west and in Mariupol significantly slowed Russian advances.Russia is now fully in control of the port city of Mariupol, after a siege lasting more than two months came to an end on 20 May.Russian troops have continued to shell Ukrainian positions across the southern regions of Zaporizhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk.According to the ISW, Russia's current priority in the south is to halt Ukrainian counterattacks, which have succeeded in regaining some territory in recent weeks.To the west, Russia had aimed to take control of Odesa and cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but its forces were blocked by a staunch defence in Mykolaiv and forced back towards Kherson by a Ukrainian counteroffensive in March.Russia was initially successful in holding on to Snake Island in the Black Sea and using air defences stationed there to protect Russian naval vessels blockading the Ukrainian coast and hindering Ukraine's maritime trade.However, Russia announced the withdrawal of its forces from the island on 30 June. Ukraine said Russian troops had been forced out by successful artillery strikes.  Russia said the withdrawal was a "gesture of goodwill."Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv in early April after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital.Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have seen missile attacks but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground.To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Long queues formed at filling stations and community centres across the capital, Colombo, on Monday, thronged by thousands of weary residents.Fresh supplies came as a relief for a city on edge after months of shortages of fuel, food and other basics.The financial crisis is the worst the country has seen since independence.Rampant inflation has made prices soar and the country's foreign currency reserves have all but run out, leaving it struggling to import food, fuel and medicine.Anger and frustration boiled over at the weekend. Tens of thousands of protesters stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in Colombo on Saturday, after months of protests over his handling of the economy. Crowds also burned down the private residence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither man was in the buildings when they were stormed. In the Slave Island district of Colombo on Monday, hundreds of people waited for tokens they could redeem for cooking gas after a shipment of liquid petroleum gas arrived in the country on Sunday. An endless line of empty blue gas cylinders wrapped around several tree-lined blocks of apartments. Those at the start of the queue had been waiting for hours.Perched on her gas cylinder, P Selvi Kalachelvi fished out a plastic bag of rotis or flour pancakes from her handbag. It was the only thing she was eating that day."I've gone six months without cooking gas now. I once waited for four days for kerosene and I still didn't get anything," she told the BBC. "Everyone is suffering, what can we do?"Cooking gas has been scarce for months, while many Many of those waiting in line were women, desperate to get gas to cook their families' meals after months of relying on chopped wood to light their fires, which they found expensive and impractical.Coupled with the soaring prices of food - some residents said the cost of chicken and beef had quadrupled since the start of the crisis - it's led most people to cut back on meals, eating only twice a day and cooking flour and vegetable dishes. Meat and fish have not been on the menu for months.This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on SaturdayThere was a stir in the crowd when police officers arrived and announced they only had enough tokens for about 1,000 families. Dozens of anxious residents trailed a policeman as he made his way down the row of cylinders, counting them one by one.He reached the end of the line - there were enough tokens for everyone. Relief flashed across the faces of the crowd.Across town at a Lanka IOC petrol station, soldiers and police officers directed traffic and monitored the line. Quarrels occasionally broke out as drivers jostled in a slow-moving queue. Petrol station attendants filled their tanks while clutching thick wads of cash, as drivers forked out large sums for the fuel.One tuk-tuk driver told the BBC he had started queueing three days ago, taking turns with his family members to keep watch over their vehicle.Gayan Kalanda said he had to pay 2,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($6.90; £5.80) - nearly half a day's earnings - just for five litres of petrol. It was the seventh time he'd had to wait for days for petrol and he was exhausted."We just don't feel secure in this country. We're hungry too… we just don't have a proper life in Sri Lanka," he said.Further back in the queue was Kanishka De Silva, a banker who had taken time off work to get fuel. On his car's dashboard was a slip of paper he had left overnight, with his phone number written on it along with the plea: "Please call if petrol comes.""It's been getting worse and worse," he said, pointing at the queue. "Here we have doctors, bankers, but also tuk-tuk drivers. It's been a common battle, that's why the protests have been so strong."I work nearby, so it's fine. But lots of people live on the outskirts and it's been hard to come to work. People have been cycling or walking for hours to come in."And those whose livelihoods depend on having petrol, they are the ones suffering."In late June, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel at state-run filling stations for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country's dwindling fuel stocks. It has requested emergency financial help, blaming the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners - for the crisis.But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame.The deepening economic crisis saw the president's older brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, forced to resign as prime minister in May.Both President Rajapaksa and PM Wickremesinghe have indicated they are ready to resign, but the timetable for this to happen remains unclear. Talks are taking place between leaders of political parties aimed at resolving the crisis.The protesters say they won't leave the presidential palace until Mr Rajapaksa resigns. His whereabouts remain unclear.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Weather readings dating back more than a century point to long-term changes in the UK's temperature.Yes, Britain has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century. In the past three decades, the The 10 hottest years since 1884 have all happened since 2002. And none of the coldest years has been recorded this century.In 2019, Cambridge saw the hottest temperature ever captured in the UK: 38.7C. The summer of 2018 was the UK's second-warmest - shared with 1995 - since 1884. The hottest was in 1976. A heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year.In the UK, the Met Office declares a heatwave when it records at least three days in a row with maximum temperatures exceeding a set temperature.That threshold varies by county.Heatwaves usually happen in summer when high pressure develops over an area. They can also bring so-called "tropical nights" - when night-time temperatures fail to drop below 20C. That can make it hard to sleep at night and the body can suffer, as it fails to sufficiently cool down.The Met Office says it's not clear whether heatwaves are becoming more frequent because of their sporadic nature. Climate change is This has brought more extreme weather, including record-breaking high temperatures across the world.Periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns, In the UK, A That trend is predicted to continue. It's possible that by 2100, Hot weather can be dangerous particularly for the vulnerable, including elderly people, children and people with underlying health conditions.Spending too much time in high temperatures or in the sun, There are also indirect effects like poorer mental health and an increase in accidents such as car crashes and drownings. In August 2003, 20,000 people died following a heatwave in Europe lasting 10 days, The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.Where possible, you should modify your routine and behaviour to adapt to the heat. If you can, travel in the morning or evening when temperatures are lower.

m_text : They detail the extensive help Uber got from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes.They also show how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a "kill switch" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers.Uber says its "past behaviour wasn't in line with present values" and it is a "different company" today.The Uber Files are a trove of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files involving conversations, spanning 2013 to 2017. They were leaked to While French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour.Uber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals. They show how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules.At the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals.Eventually shareholders had enough, and Uber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was "tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates" and has "installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company".Paris was the scene of Uber's first European launch, and it met stiff resistance from the taxi industry, culminating in violent protests in the streets.In August 2014, an ambitious former banker named Emmanuel Macron had just been appointed minister for the economy. He saw Uber as a source of growth and badly needed new jobs, and was keen to help.That October, he held a meeting with Mr Kalanick and other executives and lobbyists, which marked the start of a long - but little-publicised - stint as a champion of the controversial firm's interests within government.Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann described the meeting as "spectacular. Like I've never seen," the files show. "We will dance soon," he added."Emmanuel" and "Travis" were soon on first name terms, and met at least four times, the files show - in Paris, and at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Only the Davos meeting has been previously reported.At one point Uber wrote to Mr Macron saying it was "extremely grateful". "The openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations."French taxi drivers were particularly enraged by the 2014 launch of UberPop - a service which allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides, at much lower prices. Courts and parliament banned it, but Uber kept the service running as it challenged the law.Mr Macron didn't think there was a future for UberPop, but he agreed to work with the company to rewrite France's laws governing its other services."Uber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France," an email from Travis Kalanick to Mr Macron reads.On 25 June 2015, the protests became violent, and a week later Mr Macron texted Mr Kalanick with an apparent offer of help. "[I] will gather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law."The same day, Uber announced the suspension of UberPop in France.The extent of the now-president of France's relationship with the controversial global firm that was operating in violation of French law has not been revealed until now.A spokesperson for Mr Macron said in an email: "His functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles."Uber said the "suspension of UberPop was in no way followed by more favourable regulations," and a new law that came into force in 2018 resulted in France adopting "stricter regulations" that were "in no way beneficial to Uber".The files also reveal how Uber's relationship with one of Europe's top officials, European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, began significantly earlier and ran deeper than previously was known, putting her in an apparent breach of rules governing commissioners' conduct.They reveal she was in talks to join Uber's advisory board before she even left her last European post in November 2014. EU rules say commissioners have to respect a "cooling-off" period, then 18 months, during which new jobs require the approval of the commission. As a commissioner, Ms Kroes oversaw digital and competition policy, and was a high-profile scourge of big tech, playing a leading role in hitting Microsoft and But of all the companies she could have worked for after leaving, Uber was a particularly controversial choice. In her home country, the Netherlands, the UberPop ridesharing service had also brought legal and political trouble.Uber drivers were arrested in October 2014, and that December a judge in the Hague banned UberPop, threatening fines up to 100,000 euros. In March 2015, Uber's Amsterdam office was raided by Dutch police.Emails say that Ms Kroes called ministers and other members of the government to persuade them to back down during the raid.During another raid a week later, Ms Kroes again contacted a Dutch minister the Uber Files show, and, in the words of an email, "harassed" the head of the Dutch civil service.An internal email advised staff not to discuss her informal relationship externally: "Her reputation and our ability to negotiate solutions in the Netherlands and elsewhere would suffer from any casual banter inside or outside the office."The files show that the company wanted Ms Kroes to pass messages on to the office of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte.In October 2015, an email reads: "We'll get backchannel going with Neelie and the PM's Chief of Staff, to extract maximum advantage through 'giving' them the notion of a 'victory'."She wrote to the commission's Ad Hoc Ethical Committee requesting permission to join Uber's advisory board before the 18 months were up, and appealed to commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. That permission was denied, but documents show Ms Kroes continued to help the company informally until her appointment was announced, shortly after the cooling-off period had ended.This underlines that Ms Kroes was in a "clear breach" of the rules, says Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet professor of European Union law at HEC Paris. "You're proving the fact that you're doing something you are not allowed to do," he told BBC Panorama. "Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there."Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: "It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented."Ms Kroes denies that she had any "formal or informal role at Uber" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired.She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, "always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest".During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a "wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities" with the aim of promoting a "business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands", she said.A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that "Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015".Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines "strengthening oversight" of "lobbying and external engagements with policymakers" in Europe.If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the "kill switch", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers.This would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth.The files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once."Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam]," an email from his account says.The kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France.Uber says it has had no "'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world" since the new chief executive took over in 2017.A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber "used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers" and that "these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments".The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked to How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The 67-year-old was shot dead on Friday while speaking at a campaign event in the southern city of Nara.On Tuesday, a hearse carried the body of the country's longest-serving prime minister through the capital to the funeral hall where he was cremated.A private funeral had been held earlier at the Zojoji temple. Across Tokyo, flags flew at half mast and outside the temple, a long line of mourners stretched over two blocks, many carrying bouquets.The hearse travelled past the headquarters of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) before making its way to the prime minister's residence, where current PM Fumio Kishida and other lawmakers received the motorcade.After that it passed the parliament building, where Abe first entered as a lawmaker in 1993, before arriving at the Kirigaya Funeral Hall. Shinzo Abe's funeral was supposed to be a private affair, closed to all but family and friends. But Japan's public had decided otherwise. From early on Tuesday morning, they began lining up outside the giant Zojoji temple in central Tokyo to lay flowers at the small table set out to one side of the main complex. The weather forecast was heavy thunder showers, but as the funeral service began inside the crowds on the streets outside only grew larger. By 14:30 local time (06:30 GMT) there were tens of thousands of people lining the streets all the way from the Zojoji to the parliament building at Nagatacho.Outside the prime minister's office, as the funeral cortege approached, a hush fell across the crowds and all you could hear was the news helicopters circling above.Mourners bowed to Mrs Abe, sitting in the front of the hearse, holding her husband's funeral tablet. People began to sob loudly. Then some shouted out. "Abe-San, thank you so much."A few seconds later the hearse was gone. A middle-aged woman in the crowd dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. "We will never have another politician like him," she said. Abe was undoubtedly a divisive and controversial figure. His views on the history of World War Two were often troubling. But to the crowds of Japanese who turned out to say goodbye to him, "Abe-San" was just the best prime minister they'd known. Abe was one of Japan's most influential politicians. And his death has sent shockwaves through a nation where incidences of gun violence are extremely rare. Police said the gunman targeted Abe due to grievances he had with a religious group that he believed Abe was a part of. But they are still investigating what the gunman's motives were and whether he acted alone.A vigil held on Monday evening drew hundreds of dignitaries as well as thousands of ordinary Japanese citizens who came to lay flowers. "I came here to offer flowers because I think he gave the Japanese something to be proud about," said Emi Osa. Abe's death drew an outpouring of shock from prominent world leaders, with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemning the shooting as a "despicable attack".US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Kishida to express his "outrage, sadness and deep condolences", and called the assassination "a tragedy for Japan".This video can not be playedWatch: 'It's just so sad' - Mourners attend a vigil for Japan's former PM Shinzo AbeHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Those who died in these attacks, on a single day in June, are all thought to be civilians. Deaths like theirs account for more than one out of every three of those recorded in Ukraine since 24 February, according to BBC News analysis of data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled) - a US-based non-profit group that records political violence.Experts say the total number of recorded deaths is likely to be a severe underestimate. Ukraine and Russia claim the number reaches into the tens of thousands - but their claims do not match up and cannot be independently verified.To try to understand the human cost of the war, it is necessary to look at a number of sources, including the United Nations, national governments and independent monitors.This map shows where deaths have been reported during the war, up to mid-June. The southern and eastern areas of Ukraine, along the Russian border where the main ground invasion began, have borne the brunt of the violence.The data is from Acled, which, in Ukraine, counts individual incidences of violence such as armed clashes or air strikes, and their locations, once confirmed by local media and partner organisations, meaning the number of deaths it reports is more conservative than other sources. Overall, Acled has reported more than 10,000 deaths in Ukraine since the conflict began.Mariupol, in the south-east, Kharkiv, in the north-east, and Bilohorivka, in the east, have seen some of the heaviest casualties.From Acled's totals, BBC News has identified about 3,600 civilian deaths as of mid-June, while the UN has confirmed about 4,700 during the conflict up to the end of the month.Both say their figures fall far short of the actual number of deaths, because of the challenges in checking information while war is raging.The UN seeks to verify each death using police, hospital or other civil records. But Acled's data includes only those associated with a confirmed specific event - and not people who die as a direct result of the war but for other reasons such as hunger or lack of healthcare.This is particularly important"In total, we estimate [in addition to the confirmed deaths] that at least 3,000 civilians have died in besieged or contested cities because they couldn't get medical care and because of the stress on their health amid the hostilities," head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Matilda Bogner says.The leading cause of civilian deaths in Ukraine is shelling and air strikes, according to both UN reporting and BBC News analysis of Acled data.However, almost 1,000 civilians have been killed in Under the Geneva Convention and other international treaties, deliberately attacking civilians or the infrastructure vital to their survival Ukraine's prosecutor-general has accused Russia of Russia has denied all accusations.The number of soldiers dying is sensitive information and shapes the story of how the war is going for both sides, Gavin Crowden, of casualty-recording organisation Every Casualty Counts, says. "That is something that both sides will be very conscious of," he says.Ukraine has given no official total of soldiers killed during the war. But in early June, a senior Ukrainian presidential aide told BBC News 100-200 Ukrainian solders were dying in the Donbas region every day.In April, Russia said it had killed about 23,000 Ukrainian troops. Russia rarely discloses its own troop fatalities. Its most recent death count was on 25 March, when it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began. In April, the UK government said about 15,000 Russian soldiers had died.Ukraine regularly releases figures on Russian military deaths, claiming about 35,000 Russians had died as of late June.None of these claims can be verified.The UN has said it does not consider figures released by those involved in the conflict to be reliable.However, at least 4,010 Russian soldiers' deaths have beenOf those identified, 685 were officers and four were generals. Most were of lower rank, privates and non-commissioned officers (NCOs).These soldiers, whose bodies were repatriated to Russia, have been identified by name through state media, social media, official reports by local authorities and speaking to people who knew them.The number of soldiers whose bodies remain in Ukraine, or have yet to be identified, is unknown."Every day, the war takes dozens of civilian lives and the lives of combatants," Ms Bogner says."If human lives matter, these figures speak for themselves."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Friday will see the start of a run of days that will see consistently high temperatures in many regions.Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.Diuretics - sometimes called "water pills" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than "peak summer".This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave.

m_text : Lucy King couldn't wait to start her Speech and Language Therapy degree at Essex University last September. The first-year student has spina bifida and is paralysed below the knees and uses a wheelchair full-time. She also jokes about being a "female disabled lesbian who's also a feminist and Christian" and was worried about finding her community.Lucy isn't alone. UCAS - the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service - revealed to the It found 15% of disabled applicants share an LGBT identity, compared to 8% of non-disabled.The complexities of this go a lot further than just a paper exercise, it raises considerations about accessible venues, reasonable adjustments and inclusion.Lucy says moving to university was "very difficult". As well as all the usual administration and loan application she also had to arrange a care package for help with tasks including showering.But she says the hardest part was finding her disabled community."You need people to complain to, like when the lift is broken down. I found it very helpful to be able to have people who relate to me."With no Disabled Society, Lucy joined the LGBT society where she also found many disabled people - and says the UCAS figures ring true. But, she says, it would be so much better if ticking the "disabled" box on her UCAS form led to social connections as well as reasonable adjustments. This is something UCAS is hoping to address following its latest research, which revealed a record 83,220 disabled people applied last year - up from 77,000 in 2021CEO Clare Marchant says UCAS is "investing" in information to enable potential students to be able to talk to current students which she says will help people, like Lucy, find their communities more quickly.When Lucy did settle in she says societies and groups were all very accepting, but she faced discrimination in other ways.At an LGBT Christmas party she "did everything I could" to inform the host and nightclub that she used a wheelchair."But I turned up and you had to go up these very steep stairs. In the end, my dad carried me up the stairs," Lucy says.The event was held in a private room and "for no reason" there was a single step into it, meaning Lucy couldn't get to the bar although "I didn't let it stop me" having a good time. With London Pride taking place on Saturday and July being Disability Pride Month, Dr Ju Gosling, a disabled lesbian who is co-chair of Regard the LGBTQI+disabled peoples' organisation, says such incidents are a "real kick in the teeth".She's knows of another event for LGBT people of colour where organisers thought they had "ticked the intersectionality box". But it was at an upstairs venue with no accessible toilet and "completely inaccessible to disabled LGBT people of colour".She says incidents like this highlight how important it is to consider "people" rather than the minorities they might represent."It's not about having more than one identity, it's about having one unified identity and if people don't see all of those things about me, they don't know who I am."Dr Gosling says UCAS's figures reflect what she has seen in her own research although she believes the stats could be higher as many disabled people choose not to declare their sexuality in case it impacts on their care or support network.She says one of the reasons the number is higher than the general population is because discrimination can lead to disability or mental health problems due to the isolation and violence. She experienced a brain injury 20 years ago in a discriminatory attack.She also thinks long covid will change the picture again, which means adequate support and information is needed to ensure people don't face double discrimination - disability and sexual.Connor Scott-Gardner, a blind trans man studying at the University of Leeds, says he has experienced double discrimination at university.While his faculty has been "amazing", when he wanted to change his name he hit an administrative stumbling block.The university would only issue an inaccessible PDF form which he was unable to fill in because "I can't write or read". It took several stressful months before this was resolved.He says "toilets are another big one". If someone is unsure if Connor meant to enter the men's bathroom, instead of thinking it was his choice, they think "oh no, a blind person has gone in the wrong bathroom," and guide him out. "You have to laugh," he says, but it's a serious and personal matter.  Connor says recognising that people can belong to more than one group "goes a long way" and "means we plan better for everyone".Lucy, who has been appointed Disabled Student Officer, agrees. "Disability just needs to part of that conversation," she says. "Ensuring that events are held at accessible places."In the The presenters attempt blind tennis and disabled ballet dancer, Kate Stanforth, talks about teaching wheelchair-users how to tap dance...with their hands.Clare at UCAS says it is hoping to improve its own planning by connecting with disabled students long before they apply to ensure their needs are met and offer reassurances. She says some students start to think about university from the age of 10 and 56% of last year's disabled applicants specifically researched support before applying showing how "super important" it is.UCAS has called on the government to extend its Adjustment Passports to schools.Currently being trialled at the University of Wolverhampton and Manchester Metropolitan University the passports are a way to collate student information which can then be passed onto future employees without further assessments. "We know if a transition is a good transition than they're more likely to continue in their studies and be successful," Clare says, while the government adds it is "considering its next steps". Although some people may not want to disclose their disability to UCAS, Clare says it opens up lots of support options."It's not just about access arrangements once you get to university. Think about open days and interviews and auditions - universities can help with that." Dr Ju agrees planning is important, but says it's also about thinking more deeply about the people around you, especially if they require some level of care."I've come across situations where everybody thinks so-and-so is unsociable, but they're not. They just have to be back in their room at 20:00 because they're put into bed by 21:00 and they might not want to disclose that."She says for visually impaired students it might be a case of knocking on their door to "offer an elbow" to guide them to a function."Don't just assume, ask people what they need to take part."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

"I hope there's a bit of tethering."There was also a meeting with cafeteria staff, including 61-year-old cook Robert Jones, who said as he shook hands with the prince: "It's my birthday today so thanks for making the effort" "Shouldn't you have a day off?"

m_text : Thousands of Network Rail workers took part in national strike action in June. It said the offer was worth more than 5%, but depended on workers accepting "modernising reforms".But the RMT union said the offer was a real terms pay cut and would mean cutting a third of front-line maintenance roles.The company and unions have been in discussions since the RMT staged three 24-hour strikes last month which severely restricted services.Network Rail said the offer to staff, which include maintenance and signalling workers, was "conditional on achieving savings through modernising reforms", and said money was on the table for a pay deal next year too."While money is extremely tight because of the railway's financial troubles following the pandemic, we can afford to make this offer if our people accept change and compromise, which will fund it," a Network Rail spokesman said.All union members were being offered more than 5%, and the lowest paid would be getting a more than 10% pay rise, a spokesman told the BBC.In addition, there would be no compulsory redundancies for two years, which unions had been calling for, and employees and their immediate families would get 75% off rail travel.The spokesman said Network Rail hoped the fresh offer to its 20,000 employees would break the deadlock that led to strike action.The RMT union said its executive committee would consider the offer on Wednesday.It said the offer "amounts to a real terms pay cut over the next two years and will involve cutting a third of all front-line maintenance roles and 50% of all scheduled maintenance work".This is while Network Rail high level managers get a more than 40% pay increase "for adopting modest flexibility in comparison to RMT members", it said.The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said: "Network Rail and the train operating companies need to understand that RMT has done deals with both London Underground and recently Merseyrail that were well in excess of what our members are being offered here."Railway workers have lost thousands of pounds in earnings due to a pay freeze in recent years and they refuse to be short-changed again."We will not hesitate to call further strike action and seek to coordinate with Aslef and TSSA, if the rail industry will not seek a negotiated settlement with us."Members of the train drivers' union, Aslef, voted on Monday to go on strike over pay, drawing criticism from the government.Aslef balloted drivers at Chiltern, GWR, LNER, London Overground, Northern, Southeastern, TransPennine and West Midlands railways.The union said it was "happy to talk to anyone to do a deal and make sure Britain's railways aren't disrupted".How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The Lofi Girl channel - famous for its anime-inspired thumbnail - plays relaxing hip-hop music on a loop as a study and sleep aid.On Sunday, its creator announced its "radios" had been silenced after two years of continuous streaming, sparking an outcry from fans.YouTube has since confirmed the original claim was "abusive".Lofi Girl has built up 10 million subscribers with its regularly updated mixes of low-fidelity, instrumental music.It has inspired countless memes, Halloween costumes and even a The channel's two streams - beats to relax/study to and beats to chill/sleep to - have almost 800 million combined views and have racked up 21,000 hours of playtime.When both went down, fans were quick to assume it meant the death of "a hugely important part of YouTube culture".One wrote: "Lofi girl has helped me survive so many stressful study times. I loved watching 'live' and knowing that many people were also listening too."But some managed to find a funny side to it, joking that the anime character was "finally ready for her exams". When the ban was reversed, Lofi Girl's owner thanked fans for their support but said they were "shocked and disappointed" that false claims were not checked more thoroughly. "At the end of the day, it was entirely out of our control, and the sad part is that there was no way to appeal beforehand," they "We put in our best efforts to maintain high-quality livestreams around the clock for our audience and ensure they comply with streaming policy, leaving no reason for them to be taken down."Copyright is a legal right that gives the person who created something control over how it is used.

m_text : Under current government plans, the total tax burden is set to reach its highest level since the 1940s, according to official forecasts.The Tory leadership candidates are promising to reduce it but haven't specified whether they would pay for any shortfall in government finances with extra borrowing or cuts to public spending, instead emphasising that they would spur growth and thus increase government revenues.Lord Lawson - a former Conservative chancellor - has warned: "There is a danger that this leadership election is going to descend into a Dutch auction of tax cuts which are not necessarily affordable."This is a direct tax on the annual profits of businesses - essentially, a form of income tax for companies.The tax rate is currently 19% but from next April - under a decision by former Chancellor The newly appointed Chancellor The economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has been crunching the numbers. IFS economist Stuart Adam calculates that:The IFS says though that this potential £31bn annual cost doesn't allow for whether the corporation tax cut could lead to increased investment in the UK, which could make the final bill "substantially lower - though not enough for the tax cut to pay for itself".The basic rate of income tax is currently 20p in the pound and is paid on earnings between £12,571 to £50,270.This rises to 40p in the pound for earnings above £50,270 and 45p in the pound for earnings over £150,000. Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a reduction in the basic rate to 19p but not until 2024-25. Nadhim Zahawi wants to bring the income tax cut forward by one year, making it 19p in 2023. He would then reduce it to 18p in 2024. "That will give households back £900 a year on average," he claims.According to IFS economist Stuart Adam, bringing the income tax cut forward to 2023-24 would cost a "one-off" £6bn.It's thought reducing it further would cost another £6bn. National Insurance (NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age.Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak - was to fund health and social care.To try to ease the impact of the changes, Mr Sunak raised the threshold - at which people start paying NI - to £12,570. But some of his leadership rivals say this isn't enough. Ms Truss and Reversing the NI rise would cost about £13bn a year, according to the IFS's Stuart Adam.Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said cuts to personal taxes such as NI "certainly won't be paying for themselves". He said while such tax cuts would put "more money in people's pockets", they risked contributing to inflation.This is a tax - along with VAT - included in the price of petrol, diesel and other types of fuel. The price of fuel has increased dramatically in the UK - following the war in Ukraine - adding to the cost of living pressures.UK fuel duty is currently 52.95 pence per litre for petrol and diesel. In the 2022 Spring Statement, the government announced a temporary cut to fuel duty of five pence per litre.Mr Tugendhat has pledged to cut fuel duty by 10 pence per litre.Trade Minister Fuel duty brings in a lot of money for the government - an estimated £26.2bn in revenue in 2022-23, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).The government said that April's five pence per litre cut would cost £2.4bn - so any further reductions would be in the billions.Caroline Mullen and Greg Marsden, transport researchers from Leeds University, argue that cutting fuel duty would only benefit the wealthiest in society."In 2019, the highest income group in the UK drove an average of 4,893 miles per year, more than three times that of the lowest income group. "If it is the least well off that the fuel duty cut is aimed at protecting, then the tax system or benefit adjustments would surely be more targeted and effective," they said.VAT is payable on goods and services. The standard rate is 20% but VAT on domestic energy bills is currently 5%. When the UK was a member of the EU, this could not be reduced further. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove said that "when we Vote Leave, we will be able to scrap this unfair and damaging tax". But this has not happened. Getting rid of the 5% tax would cost the government about £1.7bn a year,Rishi Sunak - the former chancellor - has launched his leadership bid, saying: "Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."He hasn't come out with detailed tax cuts yet but says he wants "radical reforms" to the way businesses are taxed.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory. "I cried at night in my bed," he confesses. "I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me." Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford. The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two. Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here. Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called £3 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters. Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.  "My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better." One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with £1, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost £1.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted.When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known.Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. I have been reporting on the ups and downs of In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, "I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near." She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. "That was the happiest moment of my life," Runi smiles, "I am eternal now."Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter.Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. "Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt."Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had.For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. "When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are."Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain.Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, "It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did."He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. "I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : A video showing 27 people, including children and elderly, disembarking from the auto-rickshaw in Fatehpur has gone viral on social media.It shows a policeman counting each passenger as they exit the vehicle.An auto-rickshaw can generally carry three people, but some are modified to seat up to six passengers.The incident involving the overcrowded vehicle has been reported from Fatehpur, a town in India's most populated state of Uttar Pradesh.According to media reports, when police tried to flag down the autorickshaw for going too fast, the driver tried to speed away. Police then chased it down and forced it to stop.The police were "shocked to see over two dozen passengers inside", Rajesh Kumar, superintendent of Fatehpur police, told the Times of India newspaper. The autorickshaw has been seized for violating the speed limit and for being overloaded.On social media, videos of the incident have been watched tens of thousands of times and many Twitter users have posted humorous comments in response.Some said the incident was deserving of a "world record", while others used it to make a point about India's inadequate transport facilities. Autorickshaws are a popular mode of transport in India. Though ubiquitous, they are also expensive and have fares several times higher than buses. But they remain a lot cheaper than taxis and are hugely popular with the Indian middle class. A few years ago, Mexico's ambassador to India had made news for using an auto instead of a car to drive around Delhi.This video can not be playedThe rickshaw with diplomatic platesHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This is the day President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has promised to resign after he fled crowds who stormed his palace, but many worry he won't keep his word.A furious public blames him for their worst economic crisis in decades. Sri Lankans are struggling with rolling power cuts and fuel and food shortages.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he would step down once an all-party interim government is set up following Mr Rajapaksa's departure.But many Sri Lankans want him to leave immediately too - because once Mr Rajapaksa departs, under Sri Lanka's constitution, Mr Wickremesinghe would automatically become acting president for 30 days."If they do not go by the 13th [of July], we will restart the protests on a different level," protest organiser Father Jeevantha Peiris told the BBC. "The trade unions and civil rights groups confirm from the 14th onwards they will start a terrible, massive strike along with all the protests." A union leader later confirmed this.Student leader Wasantha Mudalige warned if the two leaders "try to fool the people, we will take drastic actions and it will be much more intense" than the mass protests on Saturday in the capital, Colombo.Thousands had swarmed the presidential palace forcing Mr Rajapaksa, an authoritarian leader whose family has dominated the island's politics for almost two decades, to flee. His whereabouts are currently unclear. Amid uncertainty on the eve of his expected departure, organisers of the Aragalaya protest movement - named after the Sinhalese word for "struggle" - announced a list of demands at a public meeting with political parties and trade unions at Colombo library.Besides demands for the resignations of the two leaders and everyone in their government, they also called for the executive presidency to be abolished, immediate economic relief and a People's Council to advise the government.They also want the country's coffers, which most believe were drained by corruption, to be replenished. How this would be achieved is not clear.Representatives of political parties in parliament were present and said they agreed with the protesters' points, with one lawmaker even saying sorry for allowing the country to slide into economic crisis under their watch. "To my other parliamentarians: we should apologise and rectify the situation, and be accountable to the people," he said as the dozens-strong crowd clapped.But some also warned the protests could not continue indefinitely as the country needed stability. "Aragalaya has to accept whoever comes into power next. You cannot keep protesting," said one representative from the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party.The question of what's next for the movement looms large.This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on SaturdaySince it began in May, it has been driven by ordinary citizens joining forces with a vast array of interest groups - from unionists and farmers to artists, students and socialists - for one single goal: removing Gotabaya Rajapaksa, his brother Mahinda and the rest of their family from power. The president is the only one of these who remains in office.But the protest movement's hydra-headed strength has also proved to be a weakness: it has been largely leaderless with no charismatic figure emerging for people to unite behind. Factions have clashed over the direction of the movement and one dispute between two socialist groups led to a physical fight that left several injured in the capital on Monday night, according to local media reports.It has also meant the protest movement for now cannot offer a contender for the country's leadership once Mr Rajapaksa goes. Deep public suspicion of politicians has meant there is no clear favourite among those in parliament either. Though the But protest organisers the BBC spoke to on Tuesday said they saw the movement remaining as a check on any future government, and were optimistic it could play a role in moving the country out of its current political and economic deadlock."With people power, it's possible," said Father Jeevantha. "The international community and the Sri Lanka diaspora, they are ready to help. People are united and ready to make sacrifices."We have a good moment now with the people's power."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : His story was a "shocking reminder" of the horrors of trafficking, the prime minister's official spokesperson added.Sir Mo Fellow Olympian Sir Brendan Foster said his story was like a "Hollywood movie".Downing Street said work to clamp down on perpetrators must continue, while praise has come from a wide variety of figures across British public life.Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he "salutes" Sir Mo Farah, describing the Olympic star as "truly inspirational" and an "amazing human".  Having fled Iraq when he was just 11-years-old himself, Mr Zahawi said it felt "painful" to learn of Sir Mo's experiences as a boy. "I salute Mo Farah. What an amazing human being to go through that trauma in childhood, and to come through it and be such a great role model is truly inspirational," he told the BBC.Sir Mo, who won four Olympic gold medals for Team GB, had previously said he came to the UK from Somalia with his parents as a refugee.This video can not be playedWATCH: People know me as Mo Farah, but it's not my nameSir Mo reveals to the programme that his real name is in fact Hussein Abdi Kahin. Mr Zahawi said he felt "lucky" to have had his parents with him when they were forced to flee from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq."I didn't understand why we were fleeing Saddam Hussein, I knew he was a dictator, I knew he was bad," he said.Sir Brendan Foster said he was "absolutely staggered" by Sir Mo's disclosure."I thought I knew the Mo Farah story and I thought I knew Mo Farah really well," Sir Brendan told the BBC.He described his story as a "Hollywood movie", adding that it was an "amazing, successful story of someone overcoming adversity."He said it was "amazing" that the Olympian had emerged from his childhood experiences with a "light-hearted personality" and "steely determination". Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for levelling up, suggested that the decision to speak out about trafficking could be a "gamechanger".London Mayor Sadiq Khan praised Sir Mo for highlighting the crime of child trafficking, adding: "We must build a future where these tragic events are never repeated".Dame Sara Thornton, the UK's Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said fear and manipulation stopped many victims of trafficking and slavery from speaking out. "They will have been told that the authorities won't help them, they will be under the control of their traffickers and their abusers, they may have been physically or psychologically threatened," she told BBC's Today programme."Victims don't realise that in fact they are victims of a crime."Comedian David Baddiel described Sir Mo as a "hero", sharing a picture of the pair, alongside fellow comedian Frank Skinner,  in a tweet which read: "Whether he's Sir Mo Farah or Hussein Abdi Kahin he's a hero."You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST or on BBC iPlayer at 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that "put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as "isolated holdouts" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: "Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator."Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are "positive consequences of global warming" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a "smooth" (longer) transition to greener energy."Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible," Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. "I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet." Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, "India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a "bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept "sledging" or "slurs". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically."Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic," wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. "And it was never more on show than this week as he sold "the Australian Way" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France."Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A "terribly messy week" for the prime minister.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care."People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute," says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. "What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life," Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP."If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat," she says. "We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this."Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, "there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed "persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment," pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as "enough evidence".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by "demonising" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.© 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

m_text : After more than four months of repeated Ukrainian bombardment, Russian forces have abandoned Snake orRussia says it has withdrawn its garrison as a "gesture of goodwill" to prove it was not obstructing grain exports, but Ukraine dismissed that claim, as Moscow continued to shell its grain stores.The island is exposed to attacks from all directions from air and sea, and the small garrison tasked with defending it - first Ukrainians and later Russians - has been described as "sitting ducks" by military experts. Seized by the Russians on 24 February, Snake Island is located just 35km (22 miles) off Ukraine's coast - well within the range of missile, artillery and drone strikes from the shore.And Ukraine's armed forces have done exactly that, claiming a series of devastating attacks on the island itself and any vessel bringing troop deployments and heavy weaponry.In April, Russia's anti-aircraft capabilities in the north-western Black Sea were significantly weakened with the sinking of the Moskva, That explains why the Kremlin was so desperate to bring in anti-aircraft systems and radio-electronic warfare to Snake Island. But it became a logistical nightmare for Russia to defend because it was so far from its main naval bases in the Black Sea.For all its attacks, Ukraine has very limited naval capacity, so has been unable to land its own force on the island. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov argues that stationing troops on Snake Island makes no sense for either side as they would become an easy target.  Instead, Mr Zhdanov advocates creating "fire control" - maintaining the capability to strike any target approaching the island.That would also give greater security to Ukraine's biggest Black Sea port of Odesa, and the whole north-western sector of the Black Sea.Russia already controls a large stretch of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, plus the Crimean Peninsula and the entire Sea of Azov. Holding Snake Island completed an effective blockade of Odesa, and meant exports of the vast majority of Ukrainian grain were impossible.It also meant the Black Sea coast became vulnerable to attack too, and military experts in Kyiv voiced fears that Russia could install long-range air defences, such as an S-400 air missile system.A look at the map also shows that Russian control of the island represented a threat to Nato member Romania - both its key port of Constanta and traffic in the mouth of the River Danube. It is not just strategically significant - this area is also rich in reserves of petroleum and gas.We've grown accustomed to this: Russia putting out a version of events that is wildly different from that presented by Ukraine or by Western governments.Moscow wants us to believe that there was no Russian retreat from Snake Island.The statement issued by the Russian Defence Ministry claims that Russian troops there had simply completed "assigned tasks" and left. It also called the departure "a goodwill gesture", to show that Russia wasn't hampering food exports from Ukraine. Considering the strategic importance of Snake Island, which has been fought over for months, and considering, too, the lack of "goodwill gestures" by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine since the invasion, this version of events will convince few outside Russia. Then again, this may be directed more at a domestic audience. The Kremlin wants the Russian public to believe that:This is not just a symbolic victory for Ukraine, it is a strategic success. For Russia this is both a setback and an embarrassing defeat.But it will not substantially change the course of the war. Russia's focus is on conquering the whole of the eastern Donbas and holding on to other areas of the south that it seized at the start of the war. Snake Island may be in a highly strategic part of the Black Sea and in an ideal spot for installing sophisticated missile systems, but ultimately it is still a very small rock.The key question is whether, by forcing the Russians out, the Ukrainians could consider resuming grain exports to reboot their war-ravaged economy. Without an effective navy, there is little chance of that yet, and Russian warships maintain their dominance over the Black Sea. "Practically, you need 10 things to happen before you can safely export grain and this is only one," says Andrew Wilson, professor of Ukrainian studies at University College London. Ukraine has rejected Russian offers to escort grain convoys from Odesa as they would require removing mines from outside the port. Turkey is actively involved in trying to negotiate an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine but the prospect of that happening appear remote at this stage.The next few weeks are seen as pivotal to Ukraine's exports - because the next harvest begins in July.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : At the bottom of a cave, perhaps; or in a basement when the power shuts off. But there's usually some faint glow coming from somewhere. Even the night sky never seems truly black, not least because there's usually a star or two twinkling in the distance.So it's hard to imagine a time when all that existed was darkness, when you could travel in any direction for millions of years and still see absolutely nothing.But this is the story that scientists tell us, of the "dark ages" that gripped the Universe before the first stars ignited. And very shortly, they intend to show us that time, or rather how it ended - how the cosmos ultimately became filled with light.They'll do it using the biggest telescope ever placed beyond the Earth: Launching in the coming days, JWST is on a mission to look deeper into the Universe - and therefore further back in time - than even the legendary Hubble Space Telescope, which it succeeds.Equipped with a 6.5m-wide (21ft) mirror and four super-sensitive instruments, Webb will stare for days at a very narrow spot on the sky to detect light that has been travelling through the immensity of space for more than 13.5 billion years."They will be just little red specks," says JWST senior project scientist and Nobel Prize winner John Mather."We think there should be stars, or galaxies, or black holes maybe beginning at 100 million years after the Big Bang. There won't be many of them to find at that time but the Webb telescope can see them if they're there, and we're lucky," the US space agency (Nasa) researcher tells It's an astounding idea that you might still be able to witness such a thing. But that's the consequence of light having a finite speed in a vast and expanding cosmos. If you keep probing deeper and deeper, you should eventually get to retrieve the light from the pioneer stars as they group together into the first galaxies.For what purpose, though? Why spend 10 years conceiving, and another 20 years building, a $10bn machine to detect some faint, red blobs on the sky?Well, essentially it comes down to the most fundamental of questions: Where do we come from? When the Universe was formed in the Big Bang, it contained only hydrogen, helium and a smattering of lithium. Nothing else.All the chemical elements in the Periodic Table heavier than these three had to be forged in stars. All the carbon that makes up living things; all the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere; all the silicon in rocks - all these atoms had to be "manufactured" in the nuclear reactions that make stars shine, and in the mighty explosions that end their existence.We're only here because the first stars and their descendants seeded the Universe with the material to make stuff."Webb's mission is about the formation of all likeness; it's the 'we're all made of stardust' argument," ponders Rebecca Bowler, a University of Oxford astronomer who's a team-member on Webb's NIRSpec instrument."It's about the formation of the first carbon atom ever. It's absolutely amazing to me that we could actually observe that process in progress."We don't know much about the first stars. We can put the laws of physics into computer models and run them to get a sense of what might be possible. And it sounds fantastical."Estimates range from anywhere of order 100 to 1,000 times the mass of our Sun," says Marcia Rieke, the principal investigator on Webb's NIRCam instrument. "And, in fact, all stars follow the rule that the length of time they can exist as a star is inversely proportional to their mass - meaning, the more massive a star, the faster it uses up its fuel. And so these early stars might have only lasted at most a million years or so."Live fast, die young. Our own Sun seems so timid in comparison. It's already burned for nearly five billion years and will probably keep on burning for another five.This video can not be playedHubble took us on an incredible journey into the pastThe emphasis on the search for the first starlight makes Webb sound like a "one note flute". It's actually anything but. It'll observe just about everything there is to see out there beyond Earth - from the icy moons and comets in our own Solar System to the colossal black holes that seem to reside at the core of all galaxies. It should be particularly adept at studying planets around other suns. Webb has, however, been tuned to look at all its targets in a very particular way... in the infrared. Hubble was designed to be sensitive to light predominantly at optical, or visible, wavelengths. That's the same type of light we detect with our eyes. Webb, on the other hand, is set up specifically to detect longer wavelengths, which, although invisible to our eyes, are exactly in the regime where the glow from the most distant objects in the Universe will show up. "Distant starlight gets stretched by the expansion of the Universe and shifts into the infrared region of the spectrum. We call it redshift," explains Richard Ellis, a University College London astronomer who's impatient to explore the end of the dark ages. "The limiting factor we have with Hubble, for example, is that it doesn't reach far enough into the infrared to detect the starlight signal we want. It's also not a particularly large telescope. It's been a pioneering facility, for sure. Amazing pictures. But the diameter of its mirror is only 2.4m, and the power of a telescope scales with the square of the diameter of the mirror. And that's where JWST comes in."It was the 18th-Century astronomer William Herschel who discovered the infrared. He also revolutionised the production of telescope mirrors. His hand-cranked polishing machines could achieve a super-smooth reflecting surface on a disc cast from an alloy of tin and copper. Herschel would have appreciated the innovation that went into producing Webb's mirrors. They're made from the metal beryllium, which is light-weight and holds its shape at very low temperatures. And then there's the gold coating. It's extremely thin, just a few hundred atoms thick, but this addition turns the mirrors into near-perfect reflectors in the infrared.Ninety-eight percent of incident light is bounced back, ensuring the emission from distant stars experiences minimal loses by the time it reaches Webb's instruments.Anyone who's seen the telescope's segmented 6.5m primary mirror will attest to its mesmerising quality. Even those who've worked on it for two decades never tire of its beauty. "There was a time when the mirror was pointed downwards and I had to climb under it to do an inspection of the aft optics," recalls Nasa's Lee Feinberg, who's led the Webb mirror team. "So, there I was in my bunny suit, looking up at all those gold surfaces and seeing myself being reflected back. It was really quite amazing - all these surfaces focusing back on me. I had this incredible feeling of energy being at the centre of it all." Hubble famously had a major problem with its primary mirror. When the telescope arrived in orbit in 1990, scientists realised the reflector hadn't been polished correctly. Its initial pictures of galaxies were blurred. It wasn't until astronauts could take up some corrective optics that Hubble started to see the cosmos with clarity. And perhaps not unreasonably, it's because of that experience that everyone asks whether Webb's mirror can be guaranteed to be flawless. August 2017 was the month that saw Hurricane Harvey stall over Texas, dumping a staggering 127 billion tonnes of rainwater on the state. It's noteworthy because in the midst of that deluge, Webb was actually "in town", in Houston, at Nasa's Johnson Space Center, undergoing critical testing that would prove its optics were fit to fly. Engineers had put the telescope in the space simulator that was used in the 1960s to run the rule over Apollo hardware, and even space-suited astronauts. Chamber A, as the vacuum vessel is known, is gargantuan in volume, and was able to swallow the telescope whole (minus its sunshield). The purpose of the three-month test was to take Webb down to its operating space temperature of just below -233C (40 kelvin), to see if all its mirrors would focus as designed. It would also give the teams working on Webb's four instruments the chance to see how their systems performed in mock off-world conditions. Assuming, that is, Hurricane Harvey would oblige.At times, the computer consoles talking to Webb inside Chamber A had to be covered in plastic sheeting to protect them from the risk of water dripping from the ceiling. But tucked away behind the thick walls of the vacuum vessel, Webb itself was secure and demonstrating it didn't have a "Hubble problem". "The segments on the primary mirror have actuators behind them that allow us to move them around, to even change their curvature," explains Lee Feinberg. "When first deployed in space, those segments will be misaligned. But all those actuators will take us from a misalignment measured in millimetres, all the way down to just nanometres. A factor of a million improvement." Those actuators will make the 18 segments behave as though they're a single, monolithic mirror. Nasa instrument systems engineer Begoña Vila adds: "This is what we demonstrated in the test chamber. We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned. But then we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations. We know Webb works."This video can not be playedGillian Wright: "The technologies on James Webb took years to develop"Gillian Wright is carrying a Tupperware box. "This isn't any old Tupperware; it's space-qualified Tupperware. It meets all the international standards for keeping things flawlessly clean for years," the UK Astronomy Technology Centre director says. If you want to understand just how brilliant Webb is, but also why it's taken so long to build - some 20 years in the construction phase - you need to look in Gillian's plastic box. It contains a spare "slicing mirror" from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) that she and colleagues have built for the telescope. About the size of a British 50-pence piece, it looks like a mini musical accordion made for a doll. The little mirror - once again coated in gold - contains a series of slanted "steps". The arrangement allows the mirror to acquire both an image of the sky but also to chop up the light from, say, a galaxy or the edge of a black hole, and then send that light into a spectrograph. This device will reveal the chemistry, temperature, density and velocity of the targets under study. "But not just at one point in the image, but at every point across the image, all at the same time. You go from 2D to 3D - to what we call a data cube," she tells me. This had been done in ground-based astronomy, but was novel for Webb. What's more the level of engineering precision required was extremely challenging. The steps had to be very carefully machined so that they had supremely sharp edges, otherwise light of different wavelengths would bleed across the mirror, contaminating the data. It took a year to convince the space agencies that MIRI's slicing mirrors would meet the specifications. And here's the thing: this is but one small component in one part of a giant telescope.  When they assembled Webb, every such element had to be tested and then tested again when joined to another element. The whole edifice was built up like a Russian doll. Former Nasa project scientist Mark Clampin explains: "Because it's such a big and complex observatory, and also because it has to work at cryogenic temperatures, you can't just put everything together at once, and then test it. You put everything into sealed, thermally isolated packages, starting with the smallest pieces and working upwards, testing at every stage. And then as everything gets bigger and bigger, it becomes virtually impossible to go back because you found a problem in a detector, let's say." Imagine towards the end of the telescope's construction they realised one of MIRI's slicing mirrors was defective. Disassembling the multi-billion-dollar observatory to get at the sub-standard part would be the nightmare of all nightmares. Mark McCaughrean is a British infrared astronomer who's worked on the project for 23 years in an advisory capacity for the European Space Agency. He's seen bits and pieces of Webb before, but just weeks before the expected launch, from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana, he's getting the chance to examine the completed observatory for the first time."I have no idea what to say. It's astonishing." There's emotion in his voice. The mirrors and insulation blankets are a blaze of gold and silver. The latter colour has a slight purple tinge to it. We're viewing Webb in its folded configuration, but still it's the size of a single decker bus. This "bus" has been upended to fit snuggly in the nosecone of its Ariane launch rocket. "It has an amazing scale to it," comments Mark. "When it unfolds in space - a bird flying freely in space - wouldn't that be a thing to see!" Webb has had to battle the naysayers all through its development. "It's too complex," they would say. And when you consider the sequence of deployments the telescope must complete in order to begin its observations of the cosmos, it is kind of scary.Engineers refer to "single point failures" to describe the actions, which, if they don't occur on cue and in the right order, are likely to scupper the whole undertaking. Webb must get past 344 of these decisive hurdles.Some actions should be very straightforward, such as the deployment of a solar panel and radio antenna in the minutes immediately after launch.Even the opening of the wings of the primary mirror ought to be regarded as a fairly standard operation. But the actions concentrated around the unfurling of the tennis court-sized shield that will keep Webb cool and protect its vision from the glare of the Sun - that's another matter."Some of the key hardware includes 140 release mechanisms, about 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors; we have bearings, springs, gears; about 400 pulleys are needed and 90 cables, totalling 1,312ft (400m)," says Krystal Puga from aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman."To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully."This video can not be playedAmber Straughn, an astrophysicist on Nasa's JWST science team, explains why the telescope is so exciting and importantFor those of us who haven't been directly involved in the project, the whole unfolding process looks terrifying. What if one of the cords pulling on the super-thin membranes snags, or, worse still, snaps? John Mather is the calming voice. His many years on the Webb venture have led him to a philosophical position. "I'm confident," he says, "and yet, I'm also aware that no matter how good a plan we have - and we have a very good plan - bad things can still happen. But my opinion has no effect on the hardware. And, consequently, my worrying also has no effect on the hardware. So I mostly don't worry." I've left the topic until last, but it cannot pass without some comment. The cost. The figure everyone quotes is $10bn (£7.5bn; €9bn). It covers the direct 20-year build period, the launch and five years of operations in space. As a cold number, it is eye-watering. But it's worth remembering that Hubble was also very expensive. The legendary observatory had cost more than $7bn in 2021 dollars by the time it had been launched and repaired. It must be nearer twice that now.  But given all that Hubble has shown us about the Universe, and our place in it, the old telescope seems good value. If Webb succeeds in showing us our atomic origins, who will continue to quibble about cost?"On face value there's a lot of zeroes, and Europe alone has spent €700m (£600m; $800m) on James Webb," says former European Space Agency project manager Peter Jensen.  "But when you look at it as a cost per inhabitant in Europe, it comes down to a cheap cup of coffee in a cheap café, drunk over a period of 20 years."© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be However, unless further action is taken, If nothing is done, Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Halfway to the capital, officials wearing protective clothing stopped the train, boarded and announced on megaphones that everyone must get off because one of the passengers had been linked to a Covid cluster. Chinese people mostly went along with such demands early in the pandemic because they believed the government knew what it was doing. Now, the authorities can't rely on such compliance.Travellers shouted back: "No! Why should we get off? How did you let this person on the train?"But they were soon bussed off to an isolation centre hundreds of kilometres away. Such measures are part of China's uncompromising "zero Covid" strategy. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly warned that no other path is acceptable. After the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the country has been kept inside a giant Covid protection bubble, shielding the population from the high death rates experienced elsewhere, but it has come at a cost - and growing political risk.In China, what the Communist Party fears above all else is major social unrest - and Mr Xi does not want to see this ahead of his move into a historic third term at a Party congress later this year.While the rest of the world is trying to live with Covid, China is the only major economy still prioritising the fight against the virus above almost everything else.So-called zero Covid measures involve mass testing, tracking and strict isolation. Just a handful of cases can spark a city-wide lockdown. Beijing has had only a few infections recently but its more than 21 million residents are required to queue for PCR tests every three days to access public buildings and even corner shops.When a Covid case is confirmed, a whole suburb can be swiftly cordoned off. It's been especially hard for businesses - shops, bars and restaurants can be seen pulling down shutters for good.Everyone in China is living under a cloud of uncertainty. It's difficult to make plans, and it makes one wonder how much longer people will put up with this. If the Party is not worried about all this, it should be. It's Yet, China has shown no signs of shifting its Covid approach. The world is looking on and asking why.In short, there are two reasons: politics and vaccines.It's not clear why China dropped the ball on vaccination rates, which are still seen as too low for the country to safely reopen. Officials fear that a widespread outbreak could overwhelm hospitals and cause many deaths."Some vulnerable groups haven't been fully vaccinated with two doses or booster shots, so we can't just give in," Professor Liang Wannian from China's National Health Commission said in March.There's been a belated move to ramp up vaccine rates - 89% of people have had two shots, but only 56% of those eligible have received a booster, according to official dataA few months ago, the situation was much worse. It's been especially worrying among the elderly. In Hong Kong, a huge proportion of those who've died have been older and unvaccinated.During the Shanghai outbreak in April, city officials said that only 38% of those over 60 had received three shots, and only 15% of those over 80 had got the first two jabs.Across the country, only 19.7% of those over 80 have had a booster. Why the reluctance? For many in China, the government's success in controlling Covid before the Omicron variant seems to have reduced the urgency for vaccination.Officials had been portraying Covid as an overseas problem, blaming passengers from abroad for bringing the virus into China and this belief took hold. People have also told the BBC that some doctors have warned those with underlying conditions of the dangers associated with vaccination - rather than of the dangers of not being vaccinated, especially for the elderly or patients in high-risk groups. Pensioners the BBC spoke to in a Beijing park said they weren't too concerned by the virus."I'm not worried about Covid. Just be careful, wear a mask," one 85-year-old woman told us. She and her husband had just received a shot that morning, she said. A man nearby said: "Covid management in Beijing is good. Beijing people, the Chinese people, listen to the government. Unlike people overseas, when asked to stay at home, we just stay at home."But Beijing is yet to have a full shutdown, with people restricted to their homes, to the extent that Shanghai, Wuhan, Xian, Jilin and other cities have. People in the capital often compare China's experience with what they think has happened abroad. State-controlled media reports heavily on Covid in other countries. But it has been much less inclined to accurately cover the chaos and hardship as residents suffering food shortages battled through the lockdown in Shanghai.So why hasn't Mr Xi's administration pushed vaccines harder? PCR tests are required for travel - why not vaccination records? Several international business groups in China have called for some of the vast resources devoted to testing and quarantine to be reallocated to a more vigorous long-term vaccine strategy. Earlier this week, the Beijing city government announced a change: proof of vaccination would be required to enter cinemas, gyms, internet cafes, libraries, museums and other entertainment venues. But, within days, state media has reported officials walking this back saying that it is not compulsory.But vaccinations are only part of the issue. A significant part of the problem seems to have started with officials having too much faith in the Party's propaganda. Government representatives have openly ridiculed other countries for opening up. China would not do this, they declared.In June, Mr Xi visited Wuhan, where the pandemic first started. State media said he stressed the value of the "dynamic zero Covid" approach and told locals the government would prioritise people and prioritise life. He was quoted as saying that, if China switched to a "herd immunity" approach, the aftermath would be unimaginable.While the Omicron variant has shown how unstoppable the virus can be, the language from the top in China remains centred on  "defeating" the virus and "winning the war against the pandemic". As a result, many people here believe that, with enough effort, the virus can somehow be expunged. If this crisis had been years away from the next Communist Party congress - which will usher in Mr Xi's third term - the mood might be different. But it is just months away.Former leader Deng Xiaoping introduced a two-term limit to prevent the rise of another figure like Mao Zedong who ruled China for nearly three decades. But that limit has now been dropped to allow If there are those in the senior ranks who don't want Chairman Xi to go the way of Chairman Mao, there are not many ways to stop it, certainly not many opportunities. What might be needed?It is hard to imagine that the last of those pre-conditions is anywhere near in place. But China's leader and his allies would always be considering the worst-case scenario to make sure it doesn't happen.In May, the party's seven-man Politburo standing committee, which sits at the top of Chinese politics, stressed the need for the "resolute struggle against all distortions, doubts and denials of our epidemic prevention policy", according to the published highlights.They would not have been discussing "doubts" about zero Covid if such wavering didn't exist. It must also have existed at a reasonably senior level. It would be surprising if questions were not being asked in the upper echelons of power. For generations, China's economy has been the most important priority and Covid is wrecking it. Economists are speculating that the country's statistics are being massaged to hide the true impact of the virus and the approach to fighting it. The World Bank predicted that But it's too late now to drop zero Covid before the Party congress. Mr Xi has to ride it out and hope for no more city-wide lockdowns before his new term.In cities which have had multiple or long lockdowns, signs of Covid fatigue are everywhere.More social media posts openly make fun of the government. In other countries this might not be unusual - in China, it represents a real shift. When Shanghai was shut down and food deliveries were not getting through, people started posting clips of the song - Do you hear the people sing? - from Les Miserables. This video can not be playedThe BBC's Stephen McDonell visited Wuhan ahead of the anniversary of the world's first Covid-19 lockdownIt doesn't mean the building of barricades is imminent, but it is a slap in the face for the government whose reputation for Covid management has gone from highly effective to bungling and inflexible.Last week, when state media quoted Beijing's party secretary having said the zero Covid approach would remain in place for at least another five years, it prompted an instant outcry on social media. There was a quick correction. Apparently there had been a misunderstanding.An announcement followed that quarantine for international arrivals would be reduced to seven days in a hotel followed by three at home. Perhaps this was a way to ease jitters and show people the government is trying to relax restrictions. But many believe China is simply kicking the can down the road - one day it's going to have to find a way forward. A potential off-ramp could involve redefining zero Covid and finding a way to declare that victory has been achieved.Until then, brush fires will keep appearing. The Party wouldn't want them to get out of control.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Composed of a single runway stretching out into the ocean, Mr Kriss notes that at its pre-pandemic peak, it handled some 700 flights a day, ushering more than 6.3 million international tourists a year to the Indonesian island."Then, one day… nothing," he says with a sweep of his hands. He expected it to last a few weeks, but it went on for two years. In 2020 the island received just one million foreign visitors, almost all before Bali and the rest of the world went into lockdown in March of that year. Then Back in February, Mr Kriss watched anxiously as the first international passenger fight for 24 months arrived from Singapore.The expat, who runs a digital marketing and web design business catering to the local tourism industry, even recorded the event on his mobile phone. Like many in Bali, he was optimistic, especially after the island ditched quarantine rules for overseas arrivals in March.But as the computer screens in his home office call up the latest visitor numbers, he says there's little cause for celebration.In May, Bali "I think it will be 10 years before Bali is back to pre-coronavirus numbers," says Mr Kriss.He believes that foreign travellers are reluctant to visit more remote destinations like Bali due to a perfect storm of the war in Ukraine, high inflation around the world, and lingering concerns about Covid-19.With Dozens of tourism businesses, from shops, to bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and villas sit empty or abandoned, with some even reclaimed by the island's pervasive and all-consuming jungle vegetation. And the streets once crowded with Australian, Asian and European tourists are now still eerily quiet. Made Suryani reopened her small souvenir store close to the Club Med Beach resort near Nusa Dua in April, even though most of the other retail units beside her remain shuttered."Before Covid, in a good month, I could earn more than two million rupiah ($140; £116) a month," she says. That was slightly below "Now sometimes I make 50,000 rupiah in a week. I borrowed money from family to survive, and I don't know how I'm going pay it back," she says.At Nusa Dua's shopping and restaurant mall Bali Collection the area that previously held some of the island's top restaurants is now fenced off and deserted. Of the remaining units, about 80% remain unoccupied."Most of these businesses are gone for good," says Kiran Vijay, who runs a crafts and jewellery store at the development.He says that the site's management have been very helpful, allowing tenants to be remain rent-free for most of the past two years. Yet Mr Vijay adds that tourist footfall is down from as many as 5,000 people a day before the pandemic to just a few hundred today. "They're going to have to lower rents significantly to attract new tenants," he adds.Yet there are some bright spots. Bali's And bookings at Bali's five-star resorts are also surprisingly robust, with high-end hotels seeing a large spike in demand. However, the vast majority of these visitors are domestic travellers from other parts of Indonesia, primarily the capital Jakarta and Surabaya, the second-largest city.Prior to Covid-19, many of these would have considered Bali too expensive. But with foreigners temporarily out of the picture, they're now able to get discounted rates, and special perks like free helicopter rides exclusively available on Indonesian travel booking sites.Many of the hotel staff are however still working on reduced salaries, some down to as little as 10% of pre-pandemic rates. But for them and the resorts, some income is better than none.Meanwhile, many hotel employees and other hospitality workers who were laid off at the start of the lockdowns went back to their home villages to work on the family farm plots. So while some commentators thought that Bali would descend into chaos during the pandemic, life carried on, helped by the island's strong family ties and Hindu culture.Businesses, meanwhile, were able to temporarily suspend operations without fear of bank foreclosure, as most properties in Bali are purchased outright in cash. Julia Lo Bue-Said is chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, an organisation that represents the UK's independent travel agents. She says that while long-haul travel from the UK to destinations such as Bali has been "slower to rebound" compared to holidays within Europe, "the appetite is there and growing"."Long haul will see a significant growth in the next 12-18 months, as despite the cost of living crisis, people are still eager to explore, travel and have something to look forward to, banking life long memories."Mr Kriss is certain that - given time - Bali will return again to its former glory. He says there is simply too much on offer in terms of natural beauty, and the friendly, open and tolerate nature of the Balinese people."Bali will come back strong as ever," he says. "I have no doubt about that. It may take years, but Balinese people are patient, and optimism is part of the fabric of their society - they believe in karma."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swim in the pool and set the PM's house on fireIt follows months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel.The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries.The price of everyday goods has risen sharply. Inflation is running at more than 50%.There have also been widespread power cuts.A lack of medicines has brought the health system The country doesn't have enough fuel for essential services like buses, trains and medical vehicles, and officials say it doesn't have enough foreign currency to import more.This lack of fuel has caused petrol and diesel prices to rise dramatically since the start of the year.In late June, the government banned the sale of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles for two weeks. It's thought to be Schools have closed, and people have been asked to work from home to help conserve supplies. As well as not being able to buy goods it needs from abroad, in May Sri Lanka The country had been given 30 days to come up with $78m (£63m) to cover interest payments, but central bank governor P Nandalal Weerasinghe said it could not pay. Two of the world's biggest credit rating agencies also confirmed Sri Lanka had defaulted on its debt payments. Failure to pay debt interest can damage a country's reputation with investors, making it harder for it to borrow the money it needs on international markets. This can further harm confidence in its currency and economy. Sri Lanka's government has more than $51bn (£39bn) in foreign debt, $6.5bn of which is owed to China, and the two countries are in negotiations about how to restructure the debt. The G7 group of leading industrial countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the US - has said it supports Sri Lanka's attempts to reduce its debt repayments.The Sri Lankan government is also in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about a possible $3bn (£2.5bn) loan. The IMF - which works with its 190 member countries to stabilise the world economy - has said the government would have to raise interest rates and taxes as a condition of any deal. It would also require a stable government to be in place, so it is unclear what can be done until the president officially steps down and a new government is in place.The World Bank has agreed to lend Sri Lanka $600m, and India has offered at least $1.9bn. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has said the government will print money to pay employees' salaries, but has warned this is likely to boost inflation and lead to further price hikes.He also said state-owned Sri Lankan Airlines could be privatised. The country has asked Russia and Qatar to supply it with oil at low prices to help reduce the cost of petrol.The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019.However, many experts blame economic mismanagement.At the end of its civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka chose to focus on providing goods to its domestic market, instead of trying to boost foreign trade.This meant its income from exports to other countries remained low, while the bill for imports kept growing. Sri Lanka now imports $3bn (£2.3bn) more than it exports every year, and that is why it has run out of foreign currency. At the end of 2019, Sri Lanka had $7.6bn (£5.8bn) in foreign currency reserves, which have dropped to around $250m (£210m).President Rajapaksa has also been criticised for big tax cuts he introduced in 2019, which lost the government income of more than $1.4bn (£1.13bn) a year.When Sri Lanka's foreign currency shortages became a serious problem in early 2021, the government tried to limit them by banning imports of chemical fertiliser.It told farmers to use locally sourced organic fertilisers instead.This led to widespread crop failure. Sri Lanka had to supplement its food stocks from abroad, which made its foreign currency shortage even worse.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to "cut emissions by half in the next 10 years", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. "The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050," says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. "We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050," says Prof Siegert. "If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward." The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on "There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. "It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'." "The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. "A carbon tax needs to happen," says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. "We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour."There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. "They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure."The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. "I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods."There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. "I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26," says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to "Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one." She added: "This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be However, unless further action is taken, If nothing is done, Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : By this November, the planet will be home to 8bn.  But population growth is not as rapid as it used to be. It is now at its slowest rate since 1950 and is set to peak, says the UN, around the 2080s at about 10.4bn though some demographers believe that could happen even sooner.But the population of the world is expanding unevenly.More than half the growth we will see in the next 30 years will happen in just eight countries - the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.At the same time, some of the world's most developed economies are already seeing population decline as fertility rates fall below 2.1 children per woman, which is known as the "replacement rate". In 61 countries, the report says, populations will decline by at least 1% by 2050.With one of the lowest fertility rates in the world (at 1.15 children per woman), China has announced that its population is due to start declining next year - much earlier than previously thought. That is despite the country abandoning its one child policy in 2016 and introducing incentives for couples to have two or more children.As India's population continues to grow it will almost certainly overtake China as the country with the biggest population in the world. Fertility rates are falling globally - even in many of the countries where the population is expanding. That is because, as previous generations expand, there are more people having children, even if individually those people are having fewer children than their parents did.Growth is also largely thanks to developments in medicine and science which mean that more children are surviving into adulthood and more adults into old age. That pattern is likely to continue, which means that by 2050 the global average life expectancy will be around 77.2 years.But this pattern means that the share of the global population aged 65 years or above is projected to rise from 10% this year to 16% in 2050. Again the distribution will be unequal with some countries, in East Asia and Western Europe, already seeing more extremes in ageing.

The move, Boohoo blamed the move on the rising cost of shipping.High Street firms such as Uniqlo, Next and Zara already charge for online returns.Online shopping boomed in the pandemic, but customers are more likely to return items bought online than in store, raising costs for retailers.Analysts said other retailers were likely to follow suit in charging for returns."Shoppers have had an easy ride, but that's changing now - they will increasingly find there's a price to pay for returns," said Catherine Shuttleworth, retail expert and founder of Savvy Marketing."The costs, both financially and environmentally, have been stacking up for retailers... So retailers have been tightening up their returns policy by reducing the number of days a shopper can keep an item before expecting a return and in some cases charging a return fee," she added."We can expect to see this trend continuing and [now] we've seen Boohoo quietly introduce it. If you buy something for £10 at Boohoo, it's a real disincentive to return it if you lose £2, 20% of your investment to send it back."Online shopping gained a lot of ground during the pandemic, with a big increase in the number of items being sent back.For fashion retailers, returns can be costly. Not only do retailers often cover the costs of online returns as a way of winning customers from rivals, but it also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock.Many shoppers are also becoming more aware of the environmental impact of deliveries and returns.In May, Boohoo said soaring returns were It said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate higher than it was before the pandemic.Boohoo's brands include BoohooMan, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams.A spokesperson from Boohoo said: "As the cost of shipping has increased, we've had to look at where we can adapt without compromising what our customers love most, the convenience of shopping with us and the great value that our brands offer."This has meant that we will be applying a charge of £1.99 to returns so that we can continue to offer great prices and products and do this in a more sustainable way."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : Droughts and forest fires have hit Spain and Portugal and the scorching heat has spread to France and the UK.Temperatures are set to peak on Thursday in France and Spain and authorities have cancelled traditional fireworks displays on France's national day to reduce the risk of fires.Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and longer-lasting because of climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began.This is the picture as seen by our BBC colleagues sweltering on the continent.The heat sweeping across Spain is unusual in that it is affecting almost the whole of the country. High temperatures are often registered in the summer months, particularly in southern and central areas of the country. That is certainly the case during this heatwave, with Andalusia, Castilla La Mancha and Extremadura all seeing temperatures in the low 40s Celsius so far this week. However, northern Spain, which usually avoids extreme temperatures, is also being hit, with the north-western region of Galicia on red alert - the highest category - as it braces itself for temperatures of up to 42C in the Miño valley. Another 13 regions are on orange or yellow alert.Temperatures are expected to keep rising in many areas over the next two days. The north-eastern city of Zaragoza is forecast to see temperatures of up to 42C, while Badajoz, in the south-west, could register up to 47C on Thursday.Air quality is poor in many areas across the north because of the heat. That adds to existing health concerns caused by the hot weather, which mean that the streets of towns and villages tend to be much quieter in the afternoon.With the heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, it could break records in terms of length if it goes on into next week.An unprecedented 80% of mainland Portugal is at "exceptional" risk of fires, according to national meteorological institute IPMA.The government has put the whole of the mainland under a "state of contingency" until Friday - one notch above "state of alert" and the second-highest of three levels. That triggers local, regional and national responses, putting police and other forces at the ready, and releasing funds to hire more firefighters.This video can not be playedWatch: Wildfires break out across parts of PortugalOn Tuesday there were 849 firefighters in action at the scene of 30 fires, only three of which were deemed not under control. That is down from well over 2,000 the day before.Several major fires burning over the weekend have now been extinguished or brought under control, though not before consuming thousands of hectares of forest.But conditions are expected to gradually worsen between now and Thursday, as temperatures soar and winds are seen picking up at night in some areas. The IPMA forecasts maximum temperatures as high as 47C in the coming days.While there may be some thunderstorms, meteorologists warn that any rain may evaporate before reaching the ground.Tourism is already being affected, even in areas as yet untouched by fires.In the popular tourist destination of Sintra, near Lisbon, the national palaces, castle and other attractions are closed by government order.There are also fears that a big music festival scheduled to take place from Thursday to Saturday near the beach at Meco, in Sesimbra, south of Lisbon, and a motorbike rally in the Algarve which is one of Europe's largest will have to be cancelled.Temperatures in France are set to reach 39C in some areas of the south-west in a heatwave that will last between eight and 10 days, according to Météo France. While rising temperatures are not predicted to break records as in other European countries, there are concerns about the possible consequences.With 23 departments placed under a yellow warning, and with orange alerts potentially coming into place from Wednesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne has urged ministers to take action to minimise health risks, especially for vulnerable groups. A health plan has also been rolled out by the government in all areas on alert. Meanwhile, Thursday's 14 July Bastille Day will be somewhat less colourful, with fire risks leading to the cancellation of firework displays in some areas of the country.Although it is too early to make comparisons with the 2003 heatwave in which an estimated 15,000 people died, France is nonetheless in a state of caution.

m_text : Dozens of families - including mothers with babies - are lined up with plates to get a serving of what will likely be their only meal for the day. "We are here because we are hungry," says Chandrika Manel, a mother of four. As she kneads a ball of rice with her hands, mixing it with the lentils and spinach before feeding it to one of her children, she explains that even buying bread is a struggle. "There are times I [give them] milk and rice, but we don't cook any vegetables. They're too expensive."Depleted foreign reserves and soaring inflation have devastated Sri Lanka's economy in recent months. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa - who pushed through tax cuts that shrunk the state's coffers and borrowed heavily from China to fund ambitious infrastructure projects - has been blamed for the crisis. The pandemic, which hit tourism, and the war in Ukraine, which sent oil prices rocketing, has only made the situation worse. But now Sri Lanka is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) has told the BBC. The organisation found that 70% of the country's families have cut down on food since the start of the year, and This is Ms Manel's first visit to a community kitchen as she found her options disappearing: "The cost of living is so high, we are taking loans to survive."The kitchen is a month old - Pastor Moses Akash started it in a church hall in Colombo after meeting a single mother who lived off a jackfruit for three days."We get people who haven't had a second plate of rice for the last four months," Pastor Moses says. By his estimate, the number of people queuing up for food has grown from 50 to well over 250 a day. It's not surprising given that food prices in Sri Lanka went up by 80% in June alone. "I see a lot of children especially, most of them are malnourished," he says. Sahna, a pregnant 34-year-old who goes by her first name only, is also in the queue with her three young children. She is due in September and anxious about the future. "My children are miserable. They're suffering in every possible way. I can't even afford a packet of biscuits or milk for my babies."Sahna's husband, who is a labourer, earns just $10 (£8.20) a week to support the entire family. "Our leaders are living better lives. If their children are living happily, why can't my children?" she asks. By the time Sahna's child is born, things are expected to get worse. The mayor of Colombo recently said that the capital has enough food only until September.With shortages of fuel and cooking gas, and daily power cuts, families are unable to travel to buy fresh food or prepare hot meals. "Families can't buy what they used to buy. They are cutting down on meals, they are cutting down on nutritious food. So we are definitely getting into a situation where malnutrition is a major concern," said Christian Skoog, Unicef's representative in Sri Lanka. "We're trying to avoid a humanitarian crisis. We're not yet at children dying, which is good, but we need to get the support very urgently to avoid that."Unicef has appealed for urgent financial aid to treat thousands of children with acute malnutrition, and to support a million others with primary healthcare.Acute malnutrition rates could rise from 13% to 20%, with the number of severely malnourished children - currently 35,000 - doubling, says Dr Renuka Jayatissa, president of the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association.The crisis has brought forth a sense of solidarity, with people often relying on the kindness of strangers. But even kindness and hope are becoming precious commodities. Dr Saman Kumara at Colombo's Castle Street hospital says that if not for the goodwill of donors, his patients - tiny newborns - would have been at great risk. He says his hospital is now "completely dependent on donations" for essential medicines and equipment, and urged more donors to come forward as patients' lives are in danger.Back at the community kitchen, Chandrika is scooping the last morsel of food into her son's mouth. "My best days are done. But our children have so much ahead of them," she says. "I don't know what will happen as they grow up."This video can not be playedWatch: Sri Lanka protests unify a nation where ethnic fault lines run deepHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedWatch: Michael Gove asked: 'Are you a snake?'A No 10 insider criticised Mr Gove for telling Boris Johnson to quit.Mr Gove - who was sacked as levelling up secretary for urging the PM to go - told the BBC's Chris Mason he was not a snake but "a regular guy".He said he remained "an admirer of Boris himself" and hadn't given the insult "a second's thought"."Ultimately all sorts of spicy salacious things are said, you just have to put that to one side," he added.Describing his sacking in an interview with the BBC's political editor, Mr Gove said the prime minister had been "very equitable, very polite".He said he had told Mr Johnson on Wednesday, amid a wave of ministerial resignations prompted by criticism of Mr Johnson's leadership, that it was time to go."A political reality had emerged... if you lose the support of your party you have to recognise that," he said."Boris took a different view and I respect that."Although other cabinet ministers also told Mr Johnson to resign, Mr Gove was the only one to be sacked.Mr Gove has had a fraught relationship with the prime minister - and was responsible for scuppering Mr Johnson's leadership campaign in 2016, when he said Mr Johnson was not the right person to be prime minister.He Asked by Chris Mason if he thought his sacking last week was revenge, Mr Gove said he didn't know and that it was the prime minister's right "to decide who was on his team". On the likelihood of his returning to a government post, Mr Gove said he would "work with anyone" and would do "anything I can to support making economic opportunity more equal".The Surrey Heath MP has stood to be Conservative Party leader twice before - but he is not running in the current race and has instead thrown his support behind contender Kemi Badenoch.He said Mrs Badenoch, who worked with him at the Levelling Up Department, was "bright, brilliant and brave... undoubtedly a phenomenon".To progress in the contest, the contenders have to secure the backing from at least 20 MPs by 18:00 BST on Tuesday, They will be further whittled down in a series of votes among Conservative MPs.The party membership then vote on the final two and a winner will be announced on 5 September.

m_text : She is the only black homeowner in her gated Florida community. And despite her financial success, she says her attempts to buy another property are being blocked due to her skin colour.Black Americans are almost twice as likely to be denied a mortgage than their white counterparts, figures show.And only 44% of black Americans own homes, compared to nearly 75% of white people.Confronted with statistics showing the disparities, banking groups have frequently denied any discrimination, saying the numbers don't tell the full story.But Ms Cox believes she knows the reason her mortgage application has come to a grinding halt."It's because of the colour of my skin. I'm an African-American woman," she says."I know what my black friends have gone through getting loans," she adds. "And I know my white friends that really couldn't afford loans and how quickly they got them with no problem." Ms Cox has the means to buy the $310,000 property she wants in Miami without a loan but her application was going nowhere fast.The bank questioned her income, requested additional bank statements and demanded she restart the process due to filing errors, among other issues, she says."I said, 'What are you all doing? Why don't you try to close my loan?' And they said they couldn't give me an answer," the 65-year-old said.Ms Cox's experience reflects a national pattern, one that studies suggest is getting worse. According to Nationwide, roughly 44% of black Americans owned homes as of March, down from a peak of nearly 50% in 2004, data from the US Census Bureau in March shows. Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of white families in the US owned their own home.Some 19.4% of black applicants were denied a mortgage in 2021, compared with 10.8% of white applicants, according to the property firm Zillow, which analyses And those who are granted mortgages face higher interest rates, paying more than white homeowners with lower incomes, the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University has found.As such lending hurdles limit homeownership, they have contributed to a yawning wealth gap between black and white Americans, in which a typical white family holds nearly 10 times the wealth of a black household."If you look at the difference between black and white wealth, it can almost completely be explained by homeownership," says Teri Williams, president and chief operating officer of One United Bank.While prices have skyrocketed, Ms Williams says that lower incomes and credit ratings alone can't explain the gap,"There is systemic racism," she says. "That is just the bottom line."The American Bankers Association (ABA) denies that racism is behind any lending decisions."ABA firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market. It is not just morally wrong but a violation of federal and state law."Any meaningful review of mortgage lending practices for possible discrimination, as regulators and the courts have made clear, must also consider individual factors such as a borrower's credit score and credit history," the group told the BBC, adding that these can help explain "why seemingly comparable applicants may not always end up with the same lending outcome".Nicole Bachaud, economist at Zillow, agrees that credit is the "number one reason" why applicants may be denied a mortgage, but says this affects a higher proportion of black people due to the "systemic foundations underlying things"."Communities of colour are much less likely to have access to credit due to historical outcomes from things like redlining that has barred access to credit and have really left a lot of communities of colour without formal financial institutions or access to banks or other kinds of finance. It has left them out of the market entirely."Nevertheless, these disparities have helped to fuel calls for people to move their money to black-owned banks, with rapper Killer Mike among those helping to popularise the Bank Black movement.Those calls gained traction in 2016 amid outcry over the deaths of two unarmed black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who were shot by police. One United, America's largest black-owned, black-run financial institution, trademarked the Bank Black term that year.Since then, the bank has granted more than $1bn in property loans to black households. Their customer count doubled to 100,000 after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, which sparked global protests against police brutality and shone a spotlight on systemic racial gaps in the US.First-time homeowners Jacqueline Wilcox and her husband Wilbert were two of them.For years, homeownership felt like a near-impossible dream, but the lower interest rates the newlyweds found at One United helped them to afford their new Miami home, with its two bedrooms, sleek kitchen and freshly paved driveway. They got married in the living room.Ms Wilcox says black-owned banks are giving power back to black people like herself, and hopefully helping to convince the black community that buying is within their reach."I feel as though we've been placed in this box and we've been in this spot for so long that some of us have gotten so comfortable with being renters," the 56-year-old says. For her, homeownership has provided a new sense of financial stability - and freedom. "You have to have some kind of foundation. You have to leave a mark. To say that I've lived and not just existed. That's what it is for me," she says."Homeownership puts you in a whole new bracket. It's a whole other thing."

m_text : His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII.As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism.Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage.He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006.  But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard.  A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis.But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication.He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader.With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a "normal country". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII.The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself.These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones.His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII.Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack.Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change.His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach.Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections.They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor.He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was "dissatisfied with Abe" but that "it has nothing to with political grudges". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

m_text : This video can not be playedIPL: India police arrest organisers of fake cricket matchThe video is soundless - a blue strap at the bottom of the screen tells you the scores of the batting team, the two batters, the projected score and the bowling records. It says that Chennai Fighters are chasing a score of 151 set by the Gandhinagar Challengers. The outfield is brown and dusty, and the cricket pitch is a whitish carpet nailed to the ground. The Chennai team is scoring at a steady clip of nearly seven runs an over. Strokes are sometimes played but we never see a ball reach the boundary. The batters mostly run clumsy ones or twos. The umpire appears to be more enthusiastic than the players, waving his hands vigorously, signalling wides and no balls. In keeping with the rather amiable mood of the game, a bowler doesn't seem to be interested in running out a batsman who's stranded yards away from the crease. A young man comes running to the field with what looks like an ice box, and players take a drinks break. There are no close-up shots of the players, most of the fielders and no views of an audience. All this looks like a local, video-recorded Twenty20 cricket match being played somewhere in India. Except this was part of what the police call a "fake" cricket tournament involving a group of unemployed men in Gujarat state and a bunch of punters curiously based in Russia.  Acting on a tip-off, police in Mehsana district of Gujarat last week arrested four men for staging the tournament and accepting bets through social media app Telegram from punters from three cities in Russia. Bhavesh Rathod, the officer investigating the case, said one of the four men had worked in a pub in Russia and "had some contacts there, and had got them interested in betting in cricket".India hosts the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket competition. Some states such as Tamil Nadu have also launched their own franchise-model local leagues modelled on the lines of IPL. While Indian laws do not allow sports betting (except for horse racing), police say there is often a lot of illegal gambling in cricket. Joy Bhattacharjya, a sports producer and a former director of an IPL team, said fake leagues such as the one in Mehsana were purely run for illegal gambling. "Organisers live-stream these fixed games, where the umpires openly give instructions to players. They are completely staged," he said.The Mehsana "tournament" was busted after more than nine games were played in a remote location in Molipur village, the police said. They seized cricket kits, cameras and even speakers which would amplify the running commentary to "basically set the mood".The league - which was called Century Hitters T20 - had half-a-dozen "teams" named after different Indian states, nearly two dozen locals who were paid to turn out for all the teams, two umpires, and two organisers, the police said. One of the organisers doubled up as a commentator and mimicked a well-known cricket Indian pundit. Two high-definition cameras beamed the matches on a Most of the betters were based in Moscow, Voronezh and Tver, police said. To give the games a more authentic feel, a running commentary spiked with crowd sounds downloaded from the internet was blasted through speakers placed near the ground.Umpires would use walkie-talkies to communicate with the organisers, who would connect with the punters through Telegram. The umpires would also give instructions to the players and influence the outcome of the game.The "players" - who were paid 400 rupees ($5; £4.22) for a game - have already agreed to co-operate with the police in the case, according to Mr Rathod.  "I have never seen a scam like this. These guys just cleared a patch of land deep inside a village and began playing a match and beaming it on YouTube to make money through gambling. Even the local villagers were not aware of this. We know very little about the Russians who were putting bets on this game," Mr Rathod said.And what about the audiences?"There were no audiences!"

m_text : The display of war trophies, which includes a damaged T-90 tank, Buk air defence system and Msta howitzer, was unveiled on Letna Plain, a large open space a short distance from Prague Castle."This exhibition proves how vital support from partner countries is to us," Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky told the BBC via email after launching the exhibit."Russian propaganda likes to scare people that their tanks could reach Prague, Berlin or Paris. Ukrainians demonstrate - only in the form of scrap," he said.The exhibition - organised by his ministry - also features defused rockets and shells that have been raining down on Ukrainian cities since Russia's war against the country began in February. "With this exhibition, we hope to show once again the horrors of war that Russia's aggression has brought to Ukraine," Ukrainian embassy spokeswoman Tetiana Okopna told Czech Television.  "But we also want to show how Czech weapons are being used," she went on, adding that a similar exhibition was being launched in Warsaw, with others planned for Germany and the Netherlands.Standing alongside Mr Monastyrsky was his Czech counterpart Vit Rakusan, as well as the mayor of Prague Zdenek Hrib and European Commissioner Ylva Johansson. "Millions of Ukrainians have been forced to flee Russia's aggression," Ms Johansson told the crowd of onlookers assembled for the exhibition."I bow before the incredible solidarity Czechs have shown Ukrainian refugees. What you have done not only here in Prague, but across the country is an example to Europe," she added. Ukraine's outgoing ambassador Yevhen Perebyinis has played a pivotal role in drumming up support for his country amongst Czech politicians and the public. Early in the conflict, the Ukrainian embassy joined forces with the Czech defence ministry to launch a crowd-funding campaign to buy Czech weapons for the Ukrainian army. It has raised well over €50m (£42m). The Czech government, meanwhile, has been one of Ukraine's earliest - and most muscular - supporters. The Czech Republic was the first country to send tanks to Ukraine: T-72 main battle tanks from the Czech Army's active reserves. It has since sent more heavy weapons, including Mi-24 helicopters.  However, the transfers - a combination of donations and arms purchases - are shrouded in strategic ambiguity. Even after the US defence secretary Lloyd Austin publicly thanked Prague for sending its Mi-24s to Kyiv, the Czech defence ministry maintained what amounted to a diplomatic silence.  Photographs of the helicopters bearing Ukrainian insignia have since appeared on open-source intelligence sites on Twitter, apparently after being deployed to the battlefield.But while support for Ukraine among Czechs remains high, some worry about the knock-on effect of rising energy and food prices caused in part by the conflict. There are fears that people both here in the Czech Republic and across Europe will gradually lose interest in the war.  Mr Monastyrsky is not among them. "We are not afraid that Europe will lose interest in us," the minister told the BBC."We fear that even more people will die from murders by Russian soldiers, missile strikes, explosion of mines, collapsed houses, or lack of food."If the world aspires to sustainable development and peace, it must eliminate the cause of the problems - Russian aggression. It must be political exile, economic sanctions, and weapons for the Ukrainian military."

m_text : This video can not be playedWatch: Sri Lanka opposition leader tells the BBC he is ready to run for presidencyThis comes after his Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party held talks with allies to get support for the move.Sri Lanka is facing an unprecedented economic crisis which has brought thousands to the streets since March. The country has run out of cash and is struggling to import basic items like food, fuel and medicine.President Rajapaksa announced that he plans to resign this week, and the Speaker of parliament has said lawmakers will choose the next president on 20 July. Mr Premadasa told the BBC that his party and allies agreed he should be "putting my nomination for the position of presidency, if a vacancy occurs".He lost the presidential election in 2019, and would need the support of the governing alliance MPs to win.He is banking on getting it due to the popular discontent against Mr Rajapaksa and his family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for more than two decades. The country's inflation rate reached a whopping 55% in June, and millions of people are struggling to make a living. Mr Premadasa said he was ready to take part in an all-party interim government. The SJB leader has been criticised for refusing to take the post of prime minister when it was offered to him in April. His rival Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed - but has also indicated he would resign to make way for a unity government.Mr Premadasa described the current situation in Sri Lanka as "confused, uncertainty and total anarchy", saying it needs "consensus, consultation, compromise and coming togetherness".The country's usable reserves have dropped to around $250m (£210m), according to local media reports.The crippling shortage of fuel has devastated public transport. There are rolling power cuts as power plants lack enough fuel to function. Schools are closed this week as well due to the fuel crisis. Many people are trying to leave the country.Mr Premadasa has conceded that there are no quick fixes.To return the economy to 2019 levels would take approximately four to five years, he said, adding that his party had an economic plan to overcome the crisis. "We are not going to hoodwink the people. We are going to be frank and present a plan to get rid of Sri Lanka's economic ills," Mr Premadasa said. But the protesters at the Galle Face site in Colombo say that all 225 members of parliament are responsible for the current situation, and they want a new beginning with fresh and energetic people in politics.This video can not be playedWatch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on SaturdayHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Customers must now pay £1.99 to return products, with the cost deducted from their refund. The move, Boohoo blamed the move on the rising cost of shipping.High Street firms such as Uniqlo, Next and Zara already charge for online returns.Online shopping boomed in the pandemic, but customers are more likely to return items bought online than in store, raising costs for retailers.Analysts said other retailers were likely to follow suit in charging for returns."Shoppers have had an easy ride, but that's changing now - they will increasingly find there's a price to pay for returns," said Catherine Shuttleworth, retail expert and founder of Savvy Marketing."The costs, both financially and environmentally, have been stacking up for retailers... So retailers have been tightening up their returns policy by reducing the number of days a shopper can keep an item before expecting a return and in some cases charging a return fee," she added."We can expect to see this trend continuing and [now] we've seen Boohoo quietly introduce it. If you buy something for £10 at Boohoo, it's a real disincentive to return it if you lose £2, 20% of your investment to send it back."Online shopping gained a lot of ground during the pandemic, with a big increase in the number of items being sent back.For fashion retailers, returns can be costly. Not only do retailers often cover the costs of online returns as a way of winning customers from rivals, but it also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock.Many shoppers are also becoming more aware of the environmental impact of deliveries and returns.In May, Boohoo said soaring returns were It said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate higher than it was before the pandemic.Boohoo's brands include BoohooMan, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams.A spokesperson from Boohoo said: "As the cost of shipping has increased, we've had to look at where we can adapt without compromising what our customers love most, the convenience of shopping with us and the great value that our brands offer."This has meant that we will be applying a charge of £1.99 to returns so that we can continue to offer great prices and products and do this in a more sustainable way."Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

m_text : Documents show then-London mayor Boris Johnson was "the ultimate target" of the lobbying strategy.Undeclared meetings with lobbyists expose loopholes in ministerial code, campaigners say.The politicians say that lobbying rules were followed and that all business meetings were declared.A vast cache of 124,000 internal Uber records leaked to In the UK, Uber's behind-the-scenes campaign went right to the top. The files record a series of meetings between the company, its lobbyists and senior members of the then-government that went undeclared.They include meetings with the current home secretary Priti Patel, Tory leadership contender Sajid Javid, and recently sacked cabinet minister Michael Gove.The revelations are likely to prompt renewed concerns that According to the files, Uber executives later reported that former chancellor George Osborne considered himself "responsible" for the "positive" outcome. Sue Hawley, chief executive of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said the meetings should have been declared. "It certainly breaches the spirit of the rules," she says, although the rules were sufficiently ambiguous at the time that they may not have been in breach of the letter."This is a very, very controversial company. So I think in that context, it is even more extraordinary that these meetings went undeclared by so many ministers," she adds.Since its arrival in London in 2012, Uber has been bitterly opposed by black cab drivers who see their fares being undercut and their livelihoods threatened. In 2014 parts of London were Mr Johnson was reluctant to engage with Uber directly because the company was so controversial. Yet an internal Uber strategy document in 2014 identified London as "critical" to the firm's success and Mr Johnson as "the ultimate target" of Uber's influence campaign."The Mayor remains the central figure in London government… the need therefore is for a more positive image of Uber to be conveyed to Boris, by people that he trusts and respects."The Uber Files reveal how that campaign worked.The documents show that in July 2014 Uber lobbyists visited 10 Downing Street to meet then-Prime Minister David Cameron's advisers.Lobbyists reported back to Uber getting "useful intelligence on Mayor's office".According to the files, Uber lobbyists were confident their work would bear fruit. An email says that Mr Cameron's "senior staff are very with us".The documents show they also met current leadership hopeful Sajid Javid, then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and Matt Hancock, then Business Minister, during their visit to No 10.A spokesperson for Mr Javid said the "relevant departments hold no record of the meeting said to have taken place".Speaking to the BBC on Monday, during his leadership bid, Mr Javid said any meetings with Uber "would have been reported"."So if they have not been reported in the ministerial transparency declarations, then I didn't have them."Mr Hancock's spokesperson says it was the policy of government to attract tech companies to the UK and all his efforts were "above board and declared properly". The following month, Uber's controversial chief executive Travis Kalanick was invited to a small dinner with George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in California, at the home of a senior Google executive.The invitation came from Rachel Whetstone, wife of Steve Hilton, who was strategy director at the time for Mr Cameron. She had worked with him before at the TV company Carlton and Conservative HQ.At the time of the dinner she was senior vice president of communications and public policy at Google, which also had a major investment in Uber. She moved to Uber the following year.A note from Uber's public policy chief Corey Owens to Mr Kalanick makes it clear that the company regarded this as an opportunity to advance its cause with the chancellor, and not just a social occasion.It reads: "I think this is worth you doing. We were going to get you in front of Osborne when you're in London, but this is a more private affair, no hanger-on officials or staffers."Mr Osborne didn't declare the meeting."This is someone who is very personally known to the prime minister, opening doors to other ministers," Ms Hawley told the BBC. "And I think that's really, really concerning. And it feeds the perception that big business is setting the government agenda. That's really damaging to our democracy."Lawyers for Ms Whetstone said the dinner had been arranged "at the then-chancellor's request to discuss innovation with leaders in Silicon Valley," and that she has never taken "improper advantage of personal relationships with UK politicians".The The 2010 version, which was in force when these meetings occurred, said: "Ministers meet many people and organisations and consider a wide range of views as part of the formulation of Government policy. Departments will publish, at least quarterly, details of Ministers' external meetings."By 2015 London's transport authority, TfL, was considering a series of measures which would have significantly dented Uber's competitiveness and stifled its rapid growth, including a minimum five-minute wait between booking a ride and pick-up.At the time, Mr Johnson, who, as mayor had oversight of TfL, revealed how he'd been lobbied to go easy on Uber, writing that he had been deluged by "rampant, frothing, free-market Conservatives" opposed to tightening regulations on private-hire vehicles.The files show Uber had continued targeting top Tories, as well as Labour and Lib Dem MPs.That December, in a meeting that was declared, Sajid Javid met executives from Uber who reported that he was "clearly a supporter".The same day, Mr Javid met with Mr Johnson and two other cabinet ministers, where he discussed TfL's proposals, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and reported by the Daily Mail.Priti Patel, now home secretary, met with an Uber lobbyist in Paris in January 2016, when she was minister of state for employment. The meeting wasn't declared.The files show a follow up letter from the minister proposing a partnership with Uber. A spokesperson for Ms Patel said: "For official meetings such as this, civil servants are present… and responsible for making the appropriate recordings."Also in January 2016, Michael Gove, then Secretary of State for Justice met with Ms Whetstone, by then Uber's public policy chief. The meeting wasn't declared.A spokesman at Mr Gove's former department said "no official meeting took place" in January 2016. That same month TfL proposals which would have hit Uber hardest, were shelved. Uber hailed it as a "victory for common sense". When asked in the London Assembly if he had been subject to "enormous lobbying by the government" on Uber's behalf, the mayor said he The Uber Files show that shortly after the TfL proposals were shelved, Mr Osborne met Travis Kalanick at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. This time the meeting was declared."George Osborne is a strong advocate," an Uber lobbyist noted in an email after that meeting. "He liked to believe that he's responsible for the positive consultation outcome."A spokesperson for George Osborne said "all business meetings where policy affecting individual companies [sic] were properly declared", adding that far from being secret, it was the government's publicly announced policy to meet tech businesses and persuade them to invest in Britain.The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked to How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses were hit, leaving seven dead and up to 80 hurt.It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties.Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media.Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak attributed the attack to the US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launcher and spoke of a "reality collision" for the world's "second army". A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing "peaceful cities with American weapons".Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack.Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing.Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now "minus" its ammunition depot.While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line.Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians.The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close.Meanwhile, Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities has claimed further lives. The number killed in Saturday's attack on a five-storey block of flats in the eastern town of Chasiv Yar has risen to 45, including one child, local officials say. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble.The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded.BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats. There were multiple holes in the ground and shrapnel damage at the scene, she said, from what looked like cluster bombs: "People tell me it was the heaviest night of shelling they remember."

m_text : "Nobody in our organisation, no matter how special, gets a bye on the law," he told MPs.Labour have called for a probe into claims an SAS unit repeatedly killed unarmed men and detainees.The BBC found evidence suggesting the former head of special forces failed to pass on evidence to a murder inquiry.The Ministry of Defence said it could not comment on specific allegations, but that declining to comment should not be taken as acceptance of the allegations' factual accuracy.An MoD spokesperson said that British forces "served with courage and professionalism" in Afghanistan and were held to the "highest standards".Giving evidence to the Commons Defence Committee, Mr Heappey said: "We were aware of some of the allegations that I understand to be in this evening's Panorama. They've been investigated, I believe, twice and on each occasion hasn't met the evidential threshold. "But, let's be clear, if there are new allegations, new evidence that comes to light as a consequence of the Panorama investigation and that is then passed to the service police for further investigation, we will absolutely investigate it. "Nobody in our organisation, no matter how special, gets a bye on the law - and that's that."Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has yet to comment on the allegations.Later on Tuesday, an MoD spokesperson said the Royal Military Police has written to Panorama and other media organisations asking for any new material so it can be reviewed.The BBC said it would engage with the military police and considered all requests for un-broadcast material in accordance with its editorial guidelines.British special forces killed hundreds of people on night raids in Afghanistan, but were some of the shootings executions? BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton uncovers new evidence and tracks down eyewitnesses.The BBC understands that General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the former head of UK Special Forces, was briefed about the alleged unlawful killings when he was appointed in 2012 but did not pass on the evidence to the Royal Military Police, even after the RMP began a murder investigation into the SAS squadron.General Carleton-Smith, who went on to become head of the Army before stepping down last month, declined to comment for this story.BBC Panorama analysed hundreds of pages of SAS operational accounts, including reports covering more than a dozen "kill or capture" raids carried out by one SAS squadron in Helmand in 2010/11.Individuals who served with the SAS squadron on that deployment told the BBC they witnessed the SAS operatives kill unarmed people during night raids.They also said they saw the operatives using so-called "drop weapons" - AK-47s planted at a scene to justify the killing of an unarmed person.Several people who served with special forces said that SAS squadrons were competing with each other to get the most kills, and that the squadron scrutinised by the BBC was trying to achieve a higher body count than the one it had replaced.Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said: "These new allegations are deeply disturbing, and such reports cast a dark shadow over the excellent reputation of our British Special Forces. "We know similar reports during the same period about Australian Special Forces were confirmed through an independent inquiry."So the defence secretary must urgently explain to Parliament what action he'll take to verify any truth to these claims and any possible cover-up."Justice for those affected and the integrity of British forces fighting overseas must be secured."Labour MP Dan Jarvis, a former army major who served alongside special forces in Afghanistan, said: "UK Special Forces personnel are rightly revered across the world, but no-one is above the law. "Our response to terrorism must be unequivocal, but it must always be legal. Adhering to the rule of law is what ultimately sets us apart from our adversaries. "These are extremely serious allegations and undoubtedly warrant an independent inquiry. Without the truth, we risk irreparable damage to the reputation and legitimacy of British forces."Chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat, who is bidding to be leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, said he had no doubt that if there were any truth to these accusations then the MoD would "sort it out". Speaking at his leadership launch event in Westminster, the former army officer said: "Between 2005 and 2009 when I was serving in Afghanistan, I met many extraordinary, courageous, determined and brave people serving our country. "And I know that during my time in Afghanistan I neither saw nor heard any of these accusations and I know that any accusations will be investigated fully by the Ministry of Defence."He added that an investigation was "the right thing to do" to uphold the "values and standards" of the British military.Follow Panorama How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too.Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.

m_text : Nations are meeting again in Bonn to discuss progress since the Glasgow Climate Pact was signed at COP26. So, are they keeping their promises?In Glasgow, countries agreed to submit more ambitious climate plans, including cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).Carbon dioxide is Countries were given a However, recent analysis suggests that COP26 included a plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. World leaders also agreed to phase-out inefficient oil and gas subsidies. These are government payments that artificially lower the price of fossil fuels. The UN climate science body, the IPCC, says There are are now 34 countries China, However, India - the next largest consumer of coal - Fossil fuel subsidies also increased in 2021, More than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - This is seen as vital, as trees absorb Half the world's forests are in just five countries - Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China - so their actions could make a big difference.In April, US President Biden But in Brazil - home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest - Frances Seymour of research group the World Resources Institute (WRI) said this was not surprising "in light of the relaxation of environmental enforcement" by Brazil's government.Another challenge is in Russia, which is facing a significant wildfire season. It lost Richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (£72bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2022 - a pledge that was missed in 2020. Developing nations need the money to move away from fossil fuels, by doing things like investing in green technologies. They also need to prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. Despite the EU, US, Canada and Australia all increasing funding pledges, The UK, France, Germany and Japan are matching or providing more than needed.A The big emitters - China, Russia and India - are yet to join, although China Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming.  Last year, methane levels had seen their biggest annual increase since records began, Farming and the energy sector are the main sources of methane - and the increase in oil and gas use as Covid measures ease could be partially responsible.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : While heat exhaustion is not usually serious, as long as you can cool yourself down, heatstroke is a medical emergency. Here's what to look for and what to do. Heat exhaustion happens when your body is becoming too hot and struggling to regulate or cope. It can affect anyone, including fit and healthy people - especially if they are doing strenuous exercise in high temperatures or have been drinking alcohol in the sun all day. It can come on quickly, over minutes, or gradually, over hours.The symptoms you will feel are your body's way of warning you to cool down, fast.An obvious sign is excessive sweating, as well as feeling very hot and unwell with it. Other symptoms include:Young children, who might not be able to tell you about how they are feeling, may become floppy and sleepy. Heat exhaustion can turn into heatstroke, which is an emergency. Get urgent medical help. The signs to watch for and quickly act on:  Older adults and young infants, as well as people with long-term health conditions, are particularly at risk. The body's ability to regulate its temperature is not fully developed in the young and may be reduced by illness, medications or other factors in older adults. Being overweight or obese may also make it harder to cool down.If someone has heat exhaustion: Stay with them until they are better.They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes. If in any doubt, seek help.

m_text : Born in the Bronx in 1940, he emerged as a virile leading man in the 1970s. In the 90s, he returned to the limelight as a grizzled character actor capable of lending both gravitas and menace to a wide range of roles.Here are some of his most memorable screen performances.Caan was just 27 when he played knife-throwing gambler Mississippi in Howard Hawks' Western.Yet he more than held his own against his seasoned co-stars John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, even if he did have to wear three-inch lifts in his shoes.Caan was initially reluctant to make this acclaimed TV movie about Brian Piccolo, the Chicago Bears football player struck down by terminal cancer at the age of 26.But his decision to make it was vindicated when he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy alongside co-star Billy Dee Williams.Caan's role as the volatile Santino "Sonny" Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's epic portrait of organised crime saw him receive his one and only Oscar nomination.Caan briefly reprised the role two years later in a flashback scene near the end of The Godfather: Part II.The actor considered this drama about a literature professor battling a gambling addiction one of his favourite films, despite having clashed with director Karel Reisz during shooting.The film, loosely based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1866 novella, was remade in 2014 with Mark Wahlberg in the lead.Caan was cast opposite Barbra Streisand as showman Billy Rose - the third husband of vaudeville entertainer Fanny Brice - in this musical sequel to 1968's Funny Girl.Not only did it see him land a Golden Globe nomination, but it also saw him receive a gold record for his contributions to the soundtrack.The athleticism Caan displayed as a student at Michigan State University came in handy for his role as Jonathan E in Norman Jewison's futuristic thriller, set in a world where sport is literally a matter of life and death.Caan had a relatively small role in Richard Attenborough's World War II epic, but still made his mark as Staff Sergeant Eddie Dohun, a US soldier who refuses to let a comrade die on his watch, even if it means pulling a gun on an unhelpful medic.Kathy Bates may have won an Oscar for her work in this Stephen King adaptation, but it was Cann's novelist Paul Sheldon that audiences felt for as he became a bedbound captive of his "number one fan".Caan's Corleone past made him ideal to play Frank Vitale, a New York Mafioso who is less than impressed when his daughter (Jeanne Tripplehorn) gets engaged to a British auctioneer (Hugh Grant)."We got on very well," said Grant later. "My theory is that he fell slightly in love with me."A new generation warmed to Caan when he was cast as Will Ferrell's father in this seasonal comedy about a human raised in the North Pole who travels to New York to find his biological dad.Jon Favreau's fantasy also reunited the actor with Ed Asner, with whom he had appeared in El Dorado 36 years earlier.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Halfway to the capital, officials wearing protective clothing stopped the train, boarded and announced on megaphones that everyone must get off because one of the passengers had been linked to a Covid cluster. Chinese people mostly went along with such demands early in the pandemic because they believed the government knew what it was doing. Now, the authorities can't rely on such compliance.Travellers shouted back: "No! Why should we get off? How did you let this person on the train?"But they were soon bussed off to an isolation centre hundreds of kilometres away. Such measures are part of China's uncompromising "zero Covid" strategy. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly warned that no other path is acceptable. After the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the country has been kept inside a giant Covid protection bubble, shielding the population from the high death rates experienced elsewhere, but it has come at a cost - and growing political risk.In China, what the Communist Party fears above all else is major social unrest - and Mr Xi does not want to see this ahead of his move into a historic third term at a Party congress later this year.While the rest of the world is trying to live with Covid, China is the only major economy still prioritising the fight against the virus above almost everything else.So-called zero Covid measures involve mass testing, tracking and strict isolation. Just a handful of cases can spark a city-wide lockdown. Beijing has had only a few infections recently but its more than 21 million residents are required to queue for PCR tests every three days to access public buildings and even corner shops.When a Covid case is confirmed, a whole suburb can be swiftly cordoned off. It's been especially hard for businesses - shops, bars and restaurants can be seen pulling down shutters for good.Everyone in China is living under a cloud of uncertainty. It's difficult to make plans, and it makes one wonder how much longer people will put up with this. If the Party is not worried about all this, it should be. It's Yet, China has shown no signs of shifting its Covid approach. The world is looking on and asking why.In short, there are two reasons: politics and vaccines.It's not clear why China dropped the ball on vaccination rates, which are still seen as too low for the country to safely reopen. Officials fear that a widespread outbreak could overwhelm hospitals and cause many deaths."Some vulnerable groups haven't been fully vaccinated with two doses or booster shots, so we can't just give in," Professor Liang Wannian from China's National Health Commission said in March.There's been a belated move to ramp up vaccine rates - 89% of people have had two shots, but only 56% of those eligible have received a booster, according to official dataA few months ago, the situation was much worse. It's been especially worrying among the elderly. In Hong Kong, a huge proportion of those who've died have been older and unvaccinated.During the Shanghai outbreak in April, city officials said that only 38% of those over 60 had received three shots, and only 15% of those over 80 had got the first two jabs.Across the country, only 19.7% of those over 80 have had a booster. Why the reluctance? For many in China, the government's success in controlling Covid before the Omicron variant seems to have reduced the urgency for vaccination.Officials had been portraying Covid as an overseas problem, blaming passengers from abroad for bringing the virus into China and this belief took hold. People have also told the BBC that some doctors have warned those with underlying conditions of the dangers associated with vaccination - rather than of the dangers of not being vaccinated, especially for the elderly or patients in high-risk groups. Pensioners the BBC spoke to in a Beijing park said they weren't too concerned by the virus."I'm not worried about Covid. Just be careful, wear a mask," one 85-year-old woman told us. She and her husband had just received a shot that morning, she said. A man nearby said: "Covid management in Beijing is good. Beijing people, the Chinese people, listen to the government. Unlike people overseas, when asked to stay at home, we just stay at home."But Beijing is yet to have a full shutdown, with people restricted to their homes, to the extent that Shanghai, Wuhan, Xian, Jilin and other cities have. People in the capital often compare China's experience with what they think has happened abroad. State-controlled media reports heavily on Covid in other countries. But it has been much less inclined to accurately cover the chaos and hardship as residents suffering food shortages battled through the lockdown in Shanghai.So why hasn't Mr Xi's administration pushed vaccines harder? PCR tests are required for travel - why not vaccination records? Several international business groups in China have called for some of the vast resources devoted to testing and quarantine to be reallocated to a more vigorous long-term vaccine strategy. Earlier this week, the Beijing city government announced a change: proof of vaccination would be required to enter cinemas, gyms, internet cafes, libraries, museums and other entertainment venues. But, within days, state media has reported officials walking this back saying that it is not compulsory.But vaccinations are only part of the issue. A significant part of the problem seems to have started with officials having too much faith in the Party's propaganda. Government representatives have openly ridiculed other countries for opening up. China would not do this, they declared.In June, Mr Xi visited Wuhan, where the pandemic first started. State media said he stressed the value of the "dynamic zero Covid" approach and told locals the government would prioritise people and prioritise life. He was quoted as saying that, if China switched to a "herd immunity" approach, the aftermath would be unimaginable.While the Omicron variant has shown how unstoppable the virus can be, the language from the top in China remains centred on  "defeating" the virus and "winning the war against the pandemic". As a result, many people here believe that, with enough effort, the virus can somehow be expunged. If this crisis had been years away from the next Communist Party congress - which will usher in Mr Xi's third term - the mood might be different. But it is just months away.Former leader Deng Xiaoping introduced a two-term limit to prevent the rise of another figure like Mao Zedong who ruled China for nearly three decades. But that limit has now been dropped to allow If there are those in the senior ranks who don't want Chairman Xi to go the way of Chairman Mao, there are not many ways to stop it, certainly not many opportunities. What might be needed?It is hard to imagine that the last of those pre-conditions is anywhere near in place. But China's leader and his allies would always be considering the worst-case scenario to make sure it doesn't happen.In May, the party's seven-man Politburo standing committee, which sits at the top of Chinese politics, stressed the need for the "resolute struggle against all distortions, doubts and denials of our epidemic prevention policy", according to the published highlights.They would not have been discussing "doubts" about zero Covid if such wavering didn't exist. It must also have existed at a reasonably senior level. It would be surprising if questions were not being asked in the upper echelons of power. For generations, China's economy has been the most important priority and Covid is wrecking it. Economists are speculating that the country's statistics are being massaged to hide the true impact of the virus and the approach to fighting it. The World Bank predicted that But it's too late now to drop zero Covid before the Party congress. Mr Xi has to ride it out and hope for no more city-wide lockdowns before his new term.In cities which have had multiple or long lockdowns, signs of Covid fatigue are everywhere.More social media posts openly make fun of the government. In other countries this might not be unusual - in China, it represents a real shift. When Shanghai was shut down and food deliveries were not getting through, people started posting clips of the song - Do you hear the people sing? - from Les Miserables. This video can not be playedThe BBC's Stephen McDonell visited Wuhan ahead of the anniversary of the world's first Covid-19 lockdownIt doesn't mean the building of barricades is imminent, but it is a slap in the face for the government whose reputation for Covid management has gone from highly effective to bungling and inflexible.Last week, when state media quoted Beijing's party secretary having said the zero Covid approach would remain in place for at least another five years, it prompted an instant outcry on social media. There was a quick correction. Apparently there had been a misunderstanding.An announcement followed that quarantine for international arrivals would be reduced to seven days in a hotel followed by three at home. Perhaps this was a way to ease jitters and show people the government is trying to relax restrictions. But many believe China is simply kicking the can down the road - one day it's going to have to find a way forward. A potential off-ramp could involve redefining zero Covid and finding a way to declare that victory has been achieved.Until then, brush fires will keep appearing. The Party wouldn't want them to get out of control.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The university professor has been teaching online since the pandemic but for the past few months, he has been educating his students from the frontline. The 47-year-old signed up to the military after the Russian invasion but he was eager for his students to continue their education. The result? He conducts twice-weekly classes on topics such as tourism and sociology from the trenches on his phone. "I've been teaching for 27 years. I can't just abandon that. It's what I'm good at," he tells the BBC. Mr Shandor has been teaching while serving in the military since Russia invaded in February. He signed up because he wanted to fight for his country and protect his wife and daughter. "I should stop the Russians before they come to my house," he says. Mr Shandor's dedication to his job has also helped keep participation numbers up. "Even students who would skip classes before, turn up to every lecture," says one of his students, 20-year-old Iryna. "He has always told us that we have to be smart, that we are fighting for a smart nation." But teaching in the trenches is not easy, and the students have had to get used to hearing shelling in the background.. "During one class, the sounds were very loud and so the students heard everything. Then I hid in the trenches and continued to teach," he says. Through his surroundings, he's also been able to show his students shrapnel and teach them about different missiles. Mr Shandor's lessons are also something of a novelty to his fellow soldiers, who often tune into his lectures and take pictures of him at work. One of those pictures, showing him holding his phone in a trench, was posted online and went viral across Ukraine. A number of artists around the country have since made drawings and cartoons of the moment. Mr Shandor isn't the only teacher currently fighting on the frontline. According to Ukraine's Education Minister, Serhiy Shkarlet, some 900 teachers have joined the armed forces so far. "We ae proud of each and every one of them," he says. "We have people who have joined the armed forces of Ukraine in the Ministry of Education too."Others, such as Anton Tselovalnyk, have joined the territorial defence. His lessons were cancelled during the first two weeks of the war, but after time, schools that he had worked with in the past started messaging him, asking for help. The 42-year-old instantly responded, opting to teach classes in the trenches or in the nearby housing for territorial defence personnel. Nothing can stop him from missing a class, not even the cold weather. He says that at first it wasn't about teaching the kids, it was more about talking and supporting each other. "You can imagine, the children used to go to school every day and then it suddenly stopped."He has been teaching his students - who range from primary to high school - about architecture. "The most important thing now is to keep the connection between your past and your future. Teaching now is like that for me too," he says. One of his students, 17-year-old Veronika Volkova, says Mr Tselovalnyk's lectures are funny in order to keep the class in a good mood. "It's the best distraction," she says, adding that her teacher will often show the class his surroundings, telling them about the trenches he has helped build and the places where he sits and looks at the stars. "He's thoughtful and caring during lectures. Always asking for feedback, trying to keep the subject interesting for us," Ms Volkova adds. Other teachers, such as Maksym Kozhemiaka, are using their medical skills to help the military. The 41-year-old professor of trauma medicine at Zaporizhzhia State University realised he could be of use at the city's military hospital and volunteered to help. But after a few days working there, he discovered a way of helping his students continue their studies too. "We thought we could teach classes online," he says. "We already had experience in online teaching during Covid."And so after a challenging first two weeks of the war, Mr Kozhemiaka resumed teaching by letting his students watch him conduct operations online. They use a mixture of live classes and augmented reality to allow their students to participate and comment on operations even from their own homes. "We've taught young doctors and students how to deal with combat wounds," he says. Daryna Bavysta, has joined in Mr Kozhemiaka's classes and says she has learnt a lot since they restarted. "Now I understand everything that is happening on the operating table," she says. "Maksym explains everything during his online live operations - what he is doing and how," she says.  But she is worried about her teacher: "It's not only psychologically difficult but physically - you want to give everything to the people you're treating. Our soldiers."For Mr Kozhemiaka, abandoning his classes was not an option. "Teaching is the work of my life," he says. "I couldn't abandon it. We were on the right track as a country before the war and we still are, so we need to fight together for our victory and stay united.""It's important to continue working on what you did before. Why should a war stop us?"

m_text : In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.The hacker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.The 23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.But, according to the On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: "Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted."The website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: "We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws."According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified."It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn," Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. "The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. "So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself."Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: "It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. "They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities."In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was The site's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine."There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer," she said."Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. "This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely," said Mrs Ferrett.

m_text : His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII.As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism.Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage.He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006.  But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard.  A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis.But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication.He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader.With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a "normal country". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII.The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself.These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones.His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII.Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack.Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change.His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach.Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections.They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor.He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was "dissatisfied with Abe" but that "it has nothing to with political grudges". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

m_text : A rare amber warning for much of England and Wales has been issued from midnight on Sunday.That means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness from the scorching temperatures.Extreme heat is hitting Europe with Seville reaching 42C while France, Germany and Italy are expected to experience similar highs.In England the highest temperatures of the day were around London, east England and south-east England. So far 31.7C has been recorded in Wisley, Surrey, 31.5C in Charlwood, Surrey, and 31.3C at Heathrow, west London. The UK Health Security Agency has issued Level 3 heat-health alerts across the south and east of England, the Midlands and London.This requires health and social care workers to pay particular attention to high-risk groups of people such as the elderly and vulnerable.Downing Street said "significant work" was being done across government to ensure the most vulnerable were protected during the heatwave.It comes as all ambulance services in England have been put on the highest level of alert due to "extreme pressures", partly due to the hot weather.The TUC wants employers to keep workplaces cool, relax dress codes and allow flexible working to make use of the coolest hours of the day.General secretary Frances O'Grady added: "And bosses must make sure outdoor workers are protected with regular breaks, lots of fluids, plenty of sunscreen and the right protective clothing."UK law does not state a minimum or maximum temperature for workplaces but they should normally be at least 16C or 13C if much of the job involves rigorous physical effort. The Royal Life Saving Society UK has also warned people about the dangers of trying to cool off in lakes, quarries and rivers in hot weather. The charity recommends swimmers head to lifeguarded sites, not to go too far from the shore and to take a friend when swimming. The warning comes as a 16-year-old boy who died Forecasters are predicting that the UK could face its hottest day ever next week.The current record was in July 2019 when 38.7C was recorded at Cambridge Botanic Garden but as extreme heat builds across Sunday into Monday, next week could see that temperature being topped.Wales saw its hottest day of the year on Monday with Cardiff's Bute Park reaching 28.7C.In other heatwave developments across the UK: This video can not be playedBBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying coolHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of climate change.The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began in the latter half of the 18th century, and some experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.In England, there were 2,500 excess deaths in the summer of 2020 as a result of hot weather, and the Red Cross predicts that heat-related deaths in the UK could treble in 30 years.Portugal and Spain are currently the worst affected countries in Europe - extreme heat and drought conditions are fuelling wildfires in central Portugal where state emergency measures have been introduced. An unprecedented 80% of mainland Portugal is at "exceptional" risk of fires, according to the national meteorological institute.Wildfires and heatwaves are not unusual in this part of Europe but they are becoming more severe, happening sooner than usual and more frequently, says BBC reporter Azadeh Moshiri.BBC Weather presenter Susan Powell said this could be the longest sustained heatwave seen in Spain for 50 years.She added: "We know from climatology research that the earth's atmosphere now holds its highest energy levels on record, ie, amounts of heat."It's this global scale shift that leads to the increased likelihood of extreme weather events - such as heatwaves."On Tuesday, a group of leading UK scientists suggested that heatwaves should be named similar to storms. Seville in Spain, which is seeing its second heatwave of the season, recently started doing this.Professor Mike Tipton from the Physiological Society said naming heatwaves would raise awareness and "makes the risk to health clear". "People can't expect to continue as normal during the heatwave", he added.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Now aged 13, he was diagnosed with Since then, the family, who live in the US city of Savannah, Georgia, have taken Owain to see They also tried the medication route, but had to stop after the prescribed drugs exacerbated the boy's regular migraines, and made him sick.With ADHD continuing to affect Owain's school performance over the years, Kelcey says she was "hoping for something more, for any other option"."I could see him struggling to understand why he was not able to focus, and the frustration he had when he tried so hard and would still get distracted," she says. "It broke my heart, but I felt trapped and completely useless."Help came in the end from what initially seems very incongruous - a computer game called EndeavorRx.In 2020 it became the first such game to Currently only available on prescription from doctors in the US, EndeavorRx at first glance looks very similar to countless other  games. You control a little alien that races on a spaceship through different worlds having to collect things.But the app-based game was developed in conjunction with neuroscientists, and is designed to stimulate and improve areas of the brain that play a key role in attention function.The idea is that it trains a child with ADHD to both better multitask and ignore distractions, with a computer algorithm measuring his or her performance and customising the difficulty of the game in real time. When doctors prescribe it, the child's parents get sent an activation link that is needed before the game will play.Kelcey says she was "a little sceptical", but at the end of 2020 Owain started a three-month programme, playing the game for 25 minutes a day. He then did another round last year."He admitted it was a little harder than he expected," she says. "But he understood that he was doing it to help improve his focus. He remained super motivated despite the difficulties and frustrations that came along with it."After each of Owain's sessions she noted his daily behaviour in the app, and tracked his progress.Soon she started to see small, positive changes in his behaviour. For example, getting ready for school had become smoother, and there were no negative messages from teachers.And after failing fifth grade, Owain subsequently shot up to getting As and Bs for his work."It has been amazing to see my son so successful, but more so, seeing him have confidence in himself," Kelcey says. "He is no longer upset and confused about why he just does not get it."Eddie Martucci, chief executive of Akili, the Boston-based tech firm behind EndeavorRx, says the game has been designed to boost cognitive progressing."It is something that's very difficult to get through molecular means, like taking a pill. But it turns out that sensory stimuli can actually directly stimulate parts of the brain controlling cognitive function."His company now plans to launch the game in Europe in the next few years. In London, UK app Thymia is using computer games to help doctors and other medical professionals detect and diagnose mental health issues, particularly depression.One game sees the user have to try to memorise moving objects, while another is a card game that also tests his or her memory.In addition to how well the patient performs in the game, their comments and facial expressions are also monitored and evaluated by the app, which accesses their computer or mobile phone's camera and microphone.Thymia has been launched by Dr Emilia Molimpakis, who has a doctorate in linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology from University College London (UCL). She runs the business with co-founder Dr Stefano Goria, who has a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Turin.Dr Goria says the app "gathers and extracts biomarkers that are relevant for understanding depression symptoms... in a useable and engaging way".Both Akili and Thymia say that their apps should be used in addition to existing doctor-led monitoring and treatments, and not as a replacement. UK-based adolescent psychologist Angela Karanja agrees."While these are... effective inventions, they should be used alongside current existing [patient evaluation] questionnaires, which have been tested and accepted for reliability and validity, as well as doctors' input, and also alongside other treatments, not in isolation," says Ms Karanja.Fellow UK psychologist Lee Chambers says that while the use of such video games in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of mental health conditions is still in the early stages, it appears to have "potential"."Engaging with a game has the ability to remove aspects of feeling like we are being tested and measured," he says. "These types of mental health games have an ability to widen access, and track variations in the baseline data that they collect over time."Given this, it has the potential to be an early indicator and show patterns in a way we don't currently have access to."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to "cut emissions by half in the next 10 years", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. "The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050," says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. "We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050," says Prof Siegert. "If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward." The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on "There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. "It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'." "The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. "A carbon tax needs to happen," says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. "We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour."There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. "They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure."The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. "I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods."There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. "I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26," says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to "Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one." She added: "This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The groups say it's the first lawsuit to challenge so-called airline industry "greenwashing". They argue that KLM adverts and their carbon-offsetting scheme create the false impression that its flights won't make climate change worse. But KLM says the company's statements are "based on solid arguments", and that it believes its adverts "comply with the applicable legislation and regulations".Netherlands-based group Fossielvrij NL - supported by ClientEarth and Reclame.NL - is taking aim at the company's Fly Responsibly campaign, which was launched in 2019.The campaign declared the airline is "creating a more sustainable future" and is on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It features a carbon offset product called CO2Zero, which KLM says funds reforestation projects or the company's purchase of biofuels. Carbon offsets balance out greenhouse gas emissions from polluting activities. But the groups argue the claims are highly misleading. They say the airline's plan to return to pre-pandemic levels of flights The environmental groups call the advertising campaign "greenwashing" - in other words, a misleading attempt to make the company seem environmentally friendly.They claim products like CO2Zero do nothing to limit damage to the environment, and that by promoting it to customers, the Dutch airline is undermining action to minimise climate change. They're bringing the lawsuit under the EU's Unfair Consumer Practices Directive. KLM says it had discussions with the environmental groups to see if there was any room for a solution other than a court case, but that it "proved impossible"."We critically assess all our communications about sustainability, and welcome input from all our stakeholders," KLM spokesperson Marjan Rozemeijer told the BBC. "We hope that a court ruling in this case will clarify how best to shape our communications policy."If the case in Amsterdam is successful, KLM will have to withdraw the advertising, stop any similar advertising in the future and issue corrections.Hiske Arts, a Fossielvrij campaigner, said: "Flight emissions cannot be 'compensated' if customers just pay extra to plant trees or give money towards the cost of false solutions like what the industry calls 'sustainable aviation fuels'. With these messages, KLM continues to throw sand in our eyes."We're going to court to demand KLM tells the truth about its fossil-fuel dependent product. Unchecked flying is one of the fastest ways to heat up the planet. Customers need to be informed and protected from claims that suggest it is not."But KLM says its Fly Responsibly initiative focuses on "flying being a conscious choice", urging people to "think twice before boarding an aircraft". Some argue that in sectors like air travel, where there aren't any realistic "green" alternatives, carbon offsetting can play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change. But climate scientists point out that for offsetting to work, the planted trees must be maintained over their lifespan - and this is difficult to guarantee. Joana Setzer, assistant professor of climate law at the London School of Economics, says companies are in a difficult position."They're forced to show they're doing something and announce commitments, but it's not only insufficient but dangerous for them to do so, as they might find themselves sued for misleading information," Prof Setzer says."With greenwashing, it's a relatively easy and cheap case to bring, but it's also a case where you can address the advertising as well as the communications around net-zero commitments."KLM says it's committed to communicating "transparently and honestly" about the company's approach to sustainability, and that it would not be in its interest "to misinform customers". Advertising regulators have recently cracked down on misleading marketing. In April, In September 2019, This case could have broader ramifications according to Prof Setzer, who says: "One case brought and won in a country has a cascade effect. Airlines exist everywhere, consumer protection laws exist everywhere. These are easily transferable."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : "Growing up, I absolutely hated my body," the former Coronation Street actress told the Melissa was born without her right arm below the elbow and did everything she could to hide it."I would get to dates early so I could plan which side I would be sitting on, I would choreograph sex. "I literally became this master of manipulation, and it was very draining."For Melissa, who's best known for her roles in BBC One drama, Life, and ITV's Grantchester it was watching a home video from the 1990s which was the start of accepting her body. "My grandad bought his first video camera in 1990 - the year I was born. We were watching some childhood footage and I just saw this little girl on the screen and she was dancing and she was so free. "I remember sitting and watching her and thinking, 'I'm not giving you the life you deserve'. That was a massive turning point."Melissa had just started to come to terms with being disabled - dancing at parties, rather than sitting where she wouldn't stand out - when her "worst fear" was realised.In 2018, Melissa had just completed her stint as Imogen Pascoe in Coronation Street when she glanced at her phone. She had 21 missed calls from her agent. She thought it might be about her next job, "maybe it was Spielberg calling?". Excited, she called her agent."That's when she told me," Melissa says. "The worst thing that could have happened to me would have been for my iCloud to have been hacked and my intimate, explicit photos released online. "And that is exactly what had happened."In the latest Plus, Nikki Fox and Emma Tracey chat about their high street habits and why it's hard to be a shopaholic if shops are inaccessible.A newspaper had made contact to say nude images of Melissa had been leaked online and were quickly spreading across pornographic sites - including those which fetishize disability. "It felt like my life was about to be over."Not only did she fear for her career and work she does with young disabled people, but the body she was working hard to accept was being scrutinised by the world and she had no time to brace for it."Suddenly I had to become Ok with my body essentially being cast as public property," she says.Melissa turned to the internet to see for herself. She clocked that she was in photos next to Jennifer Lawrence, which had also been stolen. Melissa quipped on the Access All podcast that for a fraction of a second she thought, "wow, I've made it," before the "realisation crashed down".Then she saw the comments."I'd never seen anything like it," she says. "My body had been ripped apart as a disabled woman. "It wouldn't have got as much traction, I don't think, had it not been because it was this blond haired actress with one arm."She says there is often an unwanted, unfounded, curiosity around sex and disability and this fuelled those corners of the internet.But the situation is more nuanced than most people think, Melissa says. She had wanted to take the photographs and had done so in good faith that they would remain private. She doesn't want people to stop that because of other peoples' actions."If you want to send someone a photo, send someone a photo. Do what makes you feel good. I sent photos of a body that actually, in that moment, I felt quite good about it. Therefore, I'm not the one to blame here."Get angry if you have your privacy disrespected, but what we don't need on top of that is shame for our bodies."Melissa did get angry. Then she got creative. Later, she got funny. She had always been good at telling stories and "clowning around" and she slowly began to realise here was a story to tell, which could help her reclaim that violation and her body. "It has to come from a place of empowerment," she says. Just before the pandemic, Melissa won a place on Bafta Elevate, a scheme which supports those from underrepresented backgrounds in their careers.With experts around her, she started to write about her experience for the theatre.An early script was described by Phoebe Waller-Bridge as "exhilaratingly honest". It went on to become the one-woman show, Snatched, which has just finished its first UK-wide tour.The show delves deep into her life and insecurities and of course her darkest moment, but it's funny and accompanied by 90s music hits.It also got her back on track to accepting her body and what she went through."Doing a one woman show is the best therapy," she says. "I can talk about it so confidently, in the sense that it doesn't hurt me anymore."It has been quite the uplifting year for Melissa who also won Bafta's The Special Award for her work with TripleC which supports deaf, disabled and neurodivergent artists to work in the arts and media. The team includes comedian Laurence Clarke, who has cerebral palsy, and fellow Coronation Street alumni, Cherrylee Houston, who played Izzy Armstrong, and is a wheelchair-user.As much as it is a gateway for disabled artists to break into the industry, it is also about the industry learning about disability and inclusion.Melissa believes this lack of understanding around disability is also the root cause of some of the trolling she faced when her photos were leaked. Rather than showing hatred at the name-callers, she tries to understand and empathise with their lack of knowledge.  "If I don't have that, I will scream, I'll be upset, I'll be angry. "If we battled with anger every single day, we'd just be exhausted," she says.Melissa is currently playing Miss Scott in Grantchester, a British detective drama set in the 1950s. Its seventh series is about to be released in America where it's a big hit.It means even more people will see the person Melissa has worked so hard to love.She says facing her "worst fear" has not only helped her accept herself, but also taught her how to face other unexpected situations. "Most of the time in life, you can't change what happens to you. But the one thing that we can have freedom over is the way that we respond to it. "Sometimes that's the only thing we've got ownership over."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The decision, announced on Wednesday, was taken on the recommendation of the government's expert committee.It is expected to expand coverage of the booster dose - or precaution dose as India calls it - in the country.India has administered 48 million booster doses so far, only about 5% of the eligible population.The country began the booster dose programme in January for healthcare and frontline workers, and those about 60 years with comorbidities.It later expanded the drive to all adults. A vaccine programme for 15- to 18-year-olds began in January, and for 12- to -14-year-olds in March.The country has administered over 1.98 billion doses since its vaccination drive began in January 2021.So far, India has reported around 43.5 million Covid cases, second only to the US, and around 524,600 deaths - behind the US and Brazil.The country is currently reporting cases around the 18,000-mark every day - states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have seen a jump in daily active cases over the past few weeks. The federal government has asked states to step up surveillance for the virus, including random screening of passengers travelling from abroad.India had a slow start when vaccinations were opened for some 960 million eligible adults in January 2021.Logistical problems, supply bottlenecks, vaccine hesitancy and a debilitating second wave of Covid-19 during this period made the rollout harder.But as the situation eased, it managed to ramp up coverage, with tens of thousands of public and private health facilities offering the jab. The country delivered vaccines by drone to far-flung villages in north-east India's mountainous regions. Drones were also used to ferry doses to the eastern archipelago of Andamans and Nicobar where "transportation by boat" was taking a long time.Though the programme missed its On 17 September, India administered more than 20 million doses in a day in a record-breaking effort to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 71st birthday. In October, it crossed the one billion mark, becoming the second country after China to do so. India is currently using four vaccines - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, known locally as Covishield; Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech; Russian-made Sputnik V and Corbevax.Covishield has accounted for around 80% of the doses given to adults so far. Corbevax, which is a protein-based vaccine manufactured by Biological E, got emergency use authorisation from India's drug regulator in February 2022 for the age group of 12-18 years.In June, Covovax - made by the Serum Institute Of India - received approval for restricted emergency use in children aged between seven and 12 years.The government had also authorised In February, it also approved a new single-dose vaccine, Sputnik Light, a component of Sputnik V. People can experience side effects from vaccines. India has a three-decade-old surveillance programme for monitoring "adverse events" following immunisation. Experts say a failure to transparently report such incidents could lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.The government told the Supreme Court that the country reported more than The serious cases were "minuscule in number; where vaccines may or may not be the cause of death".The government has previously said adverse effects may not necessarily be caused by the vaccines, adding that "the risk of dying following vaccination is negligible compared to the known risk of dying due to Covid-19 disease".This video can not be playedThe jungle-trekking Covid vaccinators helping to protect remote Indian villages.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : At the bottom of a cave, perhaps; or in a basement when the power shuts off. But there's usually some faint glow coming from somewhere. Even the night sky never seems truly black, not least because there's usually a star or two twinkling in the distance.So it's hard to imagine a time when all that existed was darkness, when you could travel in any direction for millions of years and still see absolutely nothing.But this is the story that scientists tell us, of the "dark ages" that gripped the Universe before the first stars ignited. And very shortly, they intend to show us that time, or rather how it ended - how the cosmos ultimately became filled with light.They'll do it using the biggest telescope ever placed beyond the Earth: Launching in the coming days, JWST is on a mission to look deeper into the Universe - and therefore further back in time - than even the legendary Hubble Space Telescope, which it succeeds.Equipped with a 6.5m-wide (21ft) mirror and four super-sensitive instruments, Webb will stare for days at a very narrow spot on the sky to detect light that has been travelling through the immensity of space for more than 13.5 billion years."They will be just little red specks," says JWST senior project scientist and Nobel Prize winner John Mather."We think there should be stars, or galaxies, or black holes maybe beginning at 100 million years after the Big Bang. There won't be many of them to find at that time but the Webb telescope can see them if they're there, and we're lucky," the US space agency (Nasa) researcher tells It's an astounding idea that you might still be able to witness such a thing. But that's the consequence of light having a finite speed in a vast and expanding cosmos. If you keep probing deeper and deeper, you should eventually get to retrieve the light from the pioneer stars as they group together into the first galaxies.For what purpose, though? Why spend 10 years conceiving, and another 20 years building, a $10bn machine to detect some faint, red blobs on the sky?Well, essentially it comes down to the most fundamental of questions: Where do we come from? When the Universe was formed in the Big Bang, it contained only hydrogen, helium and a smattering of lithium. Nothing else.All the chemical elements in the Periodic Table heavier than these three had to be forged in stars. All the carbon that makes up living things; all the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere; all the silicon in rocks - all these atoms had to be "manufactured" in the nuclear reactions that make stars shine, and in the mighty explosions that end their existence.We're only here because the first stars and their descendants seeded the Universe with the material to make stuff."Webb's mission is about the formation of all likeness; it's the 'we're all made of stardust' argument," ponders Rebecca Bowler, a University of Oxford astronomer who's a team-member on Webb's NIRSpec instrument."It's about the formation of the first carbon atom ever. It's absolutely amazing to me that we could actually observe that process in progress."We don't know much about the first stars. We can put the laws of physics into computer models and run them to get a sense of what might be possible. And it sounds fantastical."Estimates range from anywhere of order 100 to 1,000 times the mass of our Sun," says Marcia Rieke, the principal investigator on Webb's NIRCam instrument. "And, in fact, all stars follow the rule that the length of time they can exist as a star is inversely proportional to their mass - meaning, the more massive a star, the faster it uses up its fuel. And so these early stars might have only lasted at most a million years or so."Live fast, die young. Our own Sun seems so timid in comparison. It's already burned for nearly five billion years and will probably keep on burning for another five.This video can not be playedHubble took us on an incredible journey into the pastThe emphasis on the search for the first starlight makes Webb sound like a "one note flute". It's actually anything but. It'll observe just about everything there is to see out there beyond Earth - from the icy moons and comets in our own Solar System to the colossal black holes that seem to reside at the core of all galaxies. It should be particularly adept at studying planets around other suns. Webb has, however, been tuned to look at all its targets in a very particular way... in the infrared. Hubble was designed to be sensitive to light predominantly at optical, or visible, wavelengths. That's the same type of light we detect with our eyes. Webb, on the other hand, is set up specifically to detect longer wavelengths, which, although invisible to our eyes, are exactly in the regime where the glow from the most distant objects in the Universe will show up. "Distant starlight gets stretched by the expansion of the Universe and shifts into the infrared region of the spectrum. We call it redshift," explains Richard Ellis, a University College London astronomer who's impatient to explore the end of the dark ages. "The limiting factor we have with Hubble, for example, is that it doesn't reach far enough into the infrared to detect the starlight signal we want. It's also not a particularly large telescope. It's been a pioneering facility, for sure. Amazing pictures. But the diameter of its mirror is only 2.4m, and the power of a telescope scales with the square of the diameter of the mirror. And that's where JWST comes in."It was the 18th-Century astronomer William Herschel who discovered the infrared. He also revolutionised the production of telescope mirrors. His hand-cranked polishing machines could achieve a super-smooth reflecting surface on a disc cast from an alloy of tin and copper. Herschel would have appreciated the innovation that went into producing Webb's mirrors. They're made from the metal beryllium, which is light-weight and holds its shape at very low temperatures. And then there's the gold coating. It's extremely thin, just a few hundred atoms thick, but this addition turns the mirrors into near-perfect reflectors in the infrared.Ninety-eight percent of incident light is bounced back, ensuring the emission from distant stars experiences minimal loses by the time it reaches Webb's instruments.Anyone who's seen the telescope's segmented 6.5m primary mirror will attest to its mesmerising quality. Even those who've worked on it for two decades never tire of its beauty. "There was a time when the mirror was pointed downwards and I had to climb under it to do an inspection of the aft optics," recalls Nasa's Lee Feinberg, who's led the Webb mirror team. "So, there I was in my bunny suit, looking up at all those gold surfaces and seeing myself being reflected back. It was really quite amazing - all these surfaces focusing back on me. I had this incredible feeling of energy being at the centre of it all." Hubble famously had a major problem with its primary mirror. When the telescope arrived in orbit in 1990, scientists realised the reflector hadn't been polished correctly. Its initial pictures of galaxies were blurred. It wasn't until astronauts could take up some corrective optics that Hubble started to see the cosmos with clarity. And perhaps not unreasonably, it's because of that experience that everyone asks whether Webb's mirror can be guaranteed to be flawless. August 2017 was the month that saw Hurricane Harvey stall over Texas, dumping a staggering 127 billion tonnes of rainwater on the state. It's noteworthy because in the midst of that deluge, Webb was actually "in town", in Houston, at Nasa's Johnson Space Center, undergoing critical testing that would prove its optics were fit to fly. Engineers had put the telescope in the space simulator that was used in the 1960s to run the rule over Apollo hardware, and even space-suited astronauts. Chamber A, as the vacuum vessel is known, is gargantuan in volume, and was able to swallow the telescope whole (minus its sunshield). The purpose of the three-month test was to take Webb down to its operating space temperature of just below -233C (40 kelvin), to see if all its mirrors would focus as designed. It would also give the teams working on Webb's four instruments the chance to see how their systems performed in mock off-world conditions. Assuming, that is, Hurricane Harvey would oblige.At times, the computer consoles talking to Webb inside Chamber A had to be covered in plastic sheeting to protect them from the risk of water dripping from the ceiling. But tucked away behind the thick walls of the vacuum vessel, Webb itself was secure and demonstrating it didn't have a "Hubble problem". "The segments on the primary mirror have actuators behind them that allow us to move them around, to even change their curvature," explains Lee Feinberg. "When first deployed in space, those segments will be misaligned. But all those actuators will take us from a misalignment measured in millimetres, all the way down to just nanometres. A factor of a million improvement." Those actuators will make the 18 segments behave as though they're a single, monolithic mirror. Nasa instrument systems engineer Begoña Vila adds: "This is what we demonstrated in the test chamber. We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned. But then we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations. We know Webb works."This video can not be playedGillian Wright: "The technologies on James Webb took years to develop"Gillian Wright is carrying a Tupperware box. "This isn't any old Tupperware; it's space-qualified Tupperware. It meets all the international standards for keeping things flawlessly clean for years," the UK Astronomy Technology Centre director says. If you want to understand just how brilliant Webb is, but also why it's taken so long to build - some 20 years in the construction phase - you need to look in Gillian's plastic box. It contains a spare "slicing mirror" from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) that she and colleagues have built for the telescope. About the size of a British 50-pence piece, it looks like a mini musical accordion made for a doll. The little mirror - once again coated in gold - contains a series of slanted "steps". The arrangement allows the mirror to acquire both an image of the sky but also to chop up the light from, say, a galaxy or the edge of a black hole, and then send that light into a spectrograph. This device will reveal the chemistry, temperature, density and velocity of the targets under study. "But not just at one point in the image, but at every point across the image, all at the same time. You go from 2D to 3D - to what we call a data cube," she tells me. This had been done in ground-based astronomy, but was novel for Webb. What's more the level of engineering precision required was extremely challenging. The steps had to be very carefully machined so that they had supremely sharp edges, otherwise light of different wavelengths would bleed across the mirror, contaminating the data. It took a year to convince the space agencies that MIRI's slicing mirrors would meet the specifications. And here's the thing: this is but one small component in one part of a giant telescope.  When they assembled Webb, every such element had to be tested and then tested again when joined to another element. The whole edifice was built up like a Russian doll. Former Nasa project scientist Mark Clampin explains: "Because it's such a big and complex observatory, and also because it has to work at cryogenic temperatures, you can't just put everything together at once, and then test it. You put everything into sealed, thermally isolated packages, starting with the smallest pieces and working upwards, testing at every stage. And then as everything gets bigger and bigger, it becomes virtually impossible to go back because you found a problem in a detector, let's say." Imagine towards the end of the telescope's construction they realised one of MIRI's slicing mirrors was defective. Disassembling the multi-billion-dollar observatory to get at the sub-standard part would be the nightmare of all nightmares. Mark McCaughrean is a British infrared astronomer who's worked on the project for 23 years in an advisory capacity for the European Space Agency. He's seen bits and pieces of Webb before, but just weeks before the expected launch, from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana, he's getting the chance to examine the completed observatory for the first time."I have no idea what to say. It's astonishing." There's emotion in his voice. The mirrors and insulation blankets are a blaze of gold and silver. The latter colour has a slight purple tinge to it. We're viewing Webb in its folded configuration, but still it's the size of a single decker bus. This "bus" has been upended to fit snuggly in the nosecone of its Ariane launch rocket. "It has an amazing scale to it," comments Mark. "When it unfolds in space - a bird flying freely in space - wouldn't that be a thing to see!" Webb has had to battle the naysayers all through its development. "It's too complex," they would say. And when you consider the sequence of deployments the telescope must complete in order to begin its observations of the cosmos, it is kind of scary.Engineers refer to "single point failures" to describe the actions, which, if they don't occur on cue and in the right order, are likely to scupper the whole undertaking. Webb must get past 344 of these decisive hurdles.Some actions should be very straightforward, such as the deployment of a solar panel and radio antenna in the minutes immediately after launch.Even the opening of the wings of the primary mirror ought to be regarded as a fairly standard operation. But the actions concentrated around the unfurling of the tennis court-sized shield that will keep Webb cool and protect its vision from the glare of the Sun - that's another matter."Some of the key hardware includes 140 release mechanisms, about 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors; we have bearings, springs, gears; about 400 pulleys are needed and 90 cables, totalling 1,312ft (400m)," says Krystal Puga from aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman."To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully."This video can not be playedAmber Straughn, an astrophysicist on Nasa's JWST science team, explains why the telescope is so exciting and importantFor those of us who haven't been directly involved in the project, the whole unfolding process looks terrifying. What if one of the cords pulling on the super-thin membranes snags, or, worse still, snaps? John Mather is the calming voice. His many years on the Webb venture have led him to a philosophical position. "I'm confident," he says, "and yet, I'm also aware that no matter how good a plan we have - and we have a very good plan - bad things can still happen. But my opinion has no effect on the hardware. And, consequently, my worrying also has no effect on the hardware. So I mostly don't worry." I've left the topic until last, but it cannot pass without some comment. The cost. The figure everyone quotes is $10bn (£7.5bn; €9bn). It covers the direct 20-year build period, the launch and five years of operations in space. As a cold number, it is eye-watering. But it's worth remembering that Hubble was also very expensive. The legendary observatory had cost more than $7bn in 2021 dollars by the time it had been launched and repaired. It must be nearer twice that now.  But given all that Hubble has shown us about the Universe, and our place in it, the old telescope seems good value. If Webb succeeds in showing us our atomic origins, who will continue to quibble about cost?"On face value there's a lot of zeroes, and Europe alone has spent €700m (£600m; $800m) on James Webb," says former European Space Agency project manager Peter Jensen.  "But when you look at it as a cost per inhabitant in Europe, it comes down to a cheap cup of coffee in a cheap café, drunk over a period of 20 years."© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Who chooses his successor and when will we know the result?Candidates could only enter the race if they had the backing of 20 Tory MPs.Eight candidates secured enough support.They include former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, Attorney General Suella Braverman, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, and Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt.Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat and Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi are also nominated.The 358 Tory MPs will now hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later that day. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country - when the candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Political parties don't have to say how many members they have. However, about 160,000 people were eligible to vote during the last Tory leadership election. The party says that number has since grown. Under the current rules, we will know by 5 September at the latest. The result will be announced by 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady.We could know the new prime minister sooner if one of the final two candidates drops out and isn't replaced. This happened in 2016 when Dame Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race, leaving Theresa May as the only candidate.However, Sir Graham says he is "keen" that party members get to vote this time. Not necessarily. When a prime minister resigns, there isn't automatically a general election.However, Labour wants to force a no-confidence vote in the government, which is likely to happen in Parliament on Wednesday. If a simple majority of MPs votes in favour of it, then there could be a general election. This scenario is unlikely to happen, though, because it would require the support of dozens of Conservative MPs.The latest an election can be held is Yes. Despite standing down as leader of the Conservative Party, Mr Johnson is still the prime minister. Constitutionally, there needs to be a prime minister at all times. So Mr Johnson remains in post until his successor takes over.That will happen when a new Tory leader has been appointed.Once Mr Johnson has officially resigned, the newly-elected leader will be invited to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen who - on the advice of the ruling party - appoints a new prime minister.Until he goes to the Queen and formally resigns, in theory Mr Johnson keeps all his powers.However, in reality, he lacks the authority to introduce any substantial new policies, and has promised his cabinet he will not make any "major changes of direction".He will still represent the UK abroad, and can continue to make public appointments or changes to his team of ministers.One of his final acts in office is likely to be awarding knighthoods and appointments to the House of Lords in his resignation honours list.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Here are the latest developments:Over the weekend Russia captured the city of Lysychansk and now controls the whole Luhansk region.Ukrainian forces confirmed that they had withdrawn from Lysychansk on Sunday. Russia's latest advance follows the recent capture of the nearby town of Severodonetsk.The territory mapped below by the Institute for the Study of War was accurate as of information from 3 July.President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk "thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons".Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the "complete liberation" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion.Following the capture of Lysychansk and the Luhansk region, "Russia's focus will now almost certainly switch to capturing [the region of] Donetsk" according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).Further west, Ukrainian forces are continuing to hold back Russian attacks towards Slovyansk from the direction of Izyum, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).Russian forces have suffered heavy losses since the invasion began.The MoD says Russia is likely to have suffered devastating losses among its middle and junior ranking officers. It says these losses are likely to contribute to a loss of morale and poor discipline among lower ranks.Significant quantities of Russian weaponry have also been destroyed.As a result, Russia has tried to combine some heavily depleted units, forming what some analysts have called 'Frankenstein forces' to fight in the east.Further north, Russian units are vying for control of positions north of Kharkiv and attempting to protect ground lines of communication to the Donbas, according to the ISW.Ukrainian military officials have stated that they intend to use the US-provided Himars rocket artillery systems in the area to target these lines of communication.Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.But strong resistance from Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv in the west and in Mariupol significantly slowed Russian advances.Russia is now fully in control of the port city of Mariupol, after a siege lasting more than two months came to an end on 20 May.Russian troops have continued to shell Ukrainian positions across the southern regions of Zaporizhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk.According to the ISW, Russia's current priority in the south is to halt Ukrainian counterattacks, which have succeeded in regaining some territory in recent weeks.To the west, Russia had aimed to take control of Odesa and cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but its forces were blocked by a staunch defence in Mykolaiv and forced back towards Kherson by a Ukrainian counteroffensive in March.Russia was initially successful in holding on to Snake Island in the Black Sea and using air defences stationed there to protect Russian naval vessels blockading the Ukrainian coast and hindering Ukraine's maritime trade.However, Russia announced the withdrawal of its forces from the island on 30 June. Ukraine said Russian troops had been forced out by successful artillery strikes.  Russia said the withdrawal was a "gesture of goodwill."Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv in early April after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital.Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have seen missile attacks but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground.To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Germany and the UK.Very few places have been left untouched. In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Data on Using this metric, Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. The map below, using figures collated by According to that Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic "fever cases" according to the state news agency. China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.In the UK, The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.In early May the country Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Millions of women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in June, after the Supreme Court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision.The judgement has paved the way for individual states to ban the procedure.They have become local battlegrounds in the fight to overturn or uphold abortion services. At the same time, Google says it is taking steps to remove data from users' location histories that could be used to prosecute people for visits to US abortion clinics.Women in states where abortion is banned or restricted may be forced to cross state lines to parts of the country where the procedure remains legal.Speaking at a virtual meeting with Democratic state governors, Mr Biden said he believed some US states would attempt to arrest women who crossed state lines for abortion access. "I don't think people believe that's going to happen. But it's going to happen," he said.  The president added that the government would ensure access to pills that caused abortion in states where it was prohibited.But a federal government intervention may lead to more legal challenges that may go all the way to the Supreme Court, Dr Matthew Wilson, a political science expert at Southern Methodist University, told the BBC, particularly if states believe that the federal government "is actively working to subvert and undermine state laws".The overturning of Roe v Wade has sent shockwaves throughout the  US.It was the Supreme Court ruling that ensured that pregnant women were entitled to an abortion during the first three months of their pregnancy, while allowing for legal restrictions and bans in the second and third trimester.Thirteen states have already severely curtailed or blocked abortion access since the court's decision.Mr Biden said only Democratic victories in the mid-term elections would give Congress the power to restore federal abortion rights - this will go one way or another after November, he said.The BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says there are now fears that in states limiting abortion, police could try to access search histories and geolocation data on smartphones owned by people who are pursuing plans to terminate a pregnancy.With this in mind, Google says that in the coming weeks, it will start deleting information when its systems identify a trip to an abortion clinic, counselling centre, domestic violence shelter or other facilities that provide "particularly personal" services. Entries in a user's location history will be removed soon after a visit to a sensitive location.This video can not be playedWatch: First reactions to US abortion rulingHow a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The solar-powered Airbus Zephyr S has spent 26 continuous days airborne, beating The unmanned craft flies high in the atmosphere, to avoid commercial air traffic and adverse weather.The aircraft has on-board batteries to keep it airborne overnight, meaning it does not need to stop to re-supply fuel.Flight data shows the aircraft flew from the test range in Arizona to Belize in Central America, and then back again. Airbus told the BBC it could not comment on the flight.A spokesperson for the Assured Position, Navigation and Timing/Space office of the United States Army Futures Command - a branch of the US Army - Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of Aerospace magazine, told the BBC he thought this distance marked an important milestone for the aircraft's ability to travel beyond the line of sight of its operators."They've flown over the range from 2018 when it set the previous record," he said. "It's transmitted out to this area and beyond line-of-sight communications, and it's gone somewhere else. "I think that's an important demonstration of how you would use it in reality."He said this opened the door for practical uses of the aircraft, such as military applications or even disaster relief.The aircraft can provide imagery like a satellite, but it does not have the limitation of having to orbit Earth - meaning it can remain in one position and provide constant updates.But it has another key advantage over satellites, which generally cannot return to Earth after being launched."It comes back to you," said Mr Robinson. "You can upgrade sensors on it, you can switch the payloads out, you can upgrade it with a new technology."The flight record was achieved by the latest model of the solar-powered aircraft, which was originally designed and built in the UK.Zephyr was invented by Chris Kelleher, who died in 2015. Airbus opened the first serial production facilities for this type of aircraft in Farnborough three years later, It remains airborne at the time of writing, and flight operators seemed to celebrate its 27th continuous day in the sky by referencing its heritage.Operators How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The country is also asking for money to buy 200 military reconnaissance drones.Ukrainian and Russian forces have used small consumer drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), in the war.But Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says while small drones are useful, tactics are adapting to counter them.Small and commercial drones can provide a live view of the enemy's positions, he says."Both sides in Ukraine have been able to very rapidly exploit that real-time video picture, to call down artillery fire and quickly correct it so that it's very, very accurate, even when using old school unguided artillery, on to enemy forces," he said.But he warned electronic counter-measures were becoming increasingly effective.The proposed army of drones is a complex programme involving procurement, maintenance and replacement, as well as pilot training, Ukraine says.Col Oleksii Noskov, assistant commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said: "The army of drones will allow us to constantly monitor the 2,470km-long (1,535 miles) front line and to field an effective response to enemy attacks, using modern technology."Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, told the BBC via email that the first goal of the campaign was to purchase tactical drones which have a 100-mile range and are equipped with a sophisticated camera, GPS and mapping tools.However, after studying the issue, he said "our team understood that Ukraine's army still needed quadcopters", and so he said the country was asking people to "donate their own drones".Ukraine hopes to collect thousands of multi-use and commercial UAVs.Drones which meet the minimum standards are being donated to Ukraine via two warehouses, one in Poland and the other in the US.Mr Fedorov also wants companies to get involved, adding: "This project is a great opportunity for drone manufacturers to test their equipment in harsh conditions."The campaign, which was launched on Friday, has already raised £5.7m, enabling the purchase of two military UAVs. Dozens of small drones had also been received, The military "warmate" drones, according to Mr Bronk, are a type of loitering munition manufactured in Poland. According to the company's website, the drone "constitutes a good alternative for anti-tank guided missiles".According to Mr Fedorov, hobby and commercial drones have already shown their effectiveness on the battlefield. Russia has also made use of them. Earlier this year, Mr Fedorov called on market leader "Russia is using hobby/commercial drones to strike and conduct reconnaissance in their unprovoked and unfair war," Mr Fedorov wrote."It is crucial that the world's largest commercial drone-maker, DJI, stopped sales in Russia."Valerii Iakovenko, co-founder of Ukrainian company DroneUA, told BBC News that DJI's action had pushed up costs to Ukraine, while Russia was still able to continue to obtain drones via Belarus.His company had been supplying drones and robotics to the government since before the war.Drones, along with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system and professional radio equipment, were now among the most sought-after technology, he said.And even small ones were useful mostly providing field data, locating enemy troops and correcting artillery fire."A huge number of volunteer operators that joined the Ukrainian forces are also making a difference," Mr Iakovenko said."Drone pilots of small consumer drones are providing aerial intelligence along the whole front line."It is all about the speed of information exchange between the field and in the general staff, to make decisions almost immediately."This video can not be playedWatch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troopsMr Bronk says Ukrainians in particular have been very inventive in finding ways to source and then use commercial, as well as military-grade drones.This includes "using them as improvised loitering munitions to strike targets at significant distance, including, recently, an oil refinery in Rostov with a commercial grade UAV with an improvised warhead".But tactics, he warns, are changing."What's happened in the last couple of months in Donbas is that the Russians have managed to concentrate their electronic warfare assets and integrate them well with their ongoing operations. As a result, Mr Bronk says, whenever Ukraine sends up a small UAV using radio remote control "the Russian electronic warfare kit picks it up and immediately either takes it over or just cuts the command link electronically and forces it to return".To avoid this, instead of being flown by remote control, small drones have to be programmed to fly a set route and have targets identified when footage is analysed on their return. This slow process is of limited value against moving targets, he said.Mr Bronk felt that what Ukraine needed were loitering munitions capable of targeting and attacking Russian electronic warfare systems. While hobbyist drones were useful, at the moment "grassroots support in terms of generating military equipment is probably of as much value in terms of morale for the people who are contributing, as well as the people on the front lines".

m_text : But German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume.He has accused the Kremlin of using gas "as a weapon" in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine.Mr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas.He described that as "a grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can".He said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year.In mid-June Russia's state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline's capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy.The Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow "to the whims of Russia".Canada says it is granting Siemens Canada a "time-limited and revocable permit" to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions.Germany's government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently.Pipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on.The pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia's Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days.The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now.Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme.Austria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline.Visiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Last year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia.The government has also given the go-ahead for Germany's first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven.Another undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war.If Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating.A leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that "if Nord Stream 1 doesn't come back on at all, let's say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level"."That would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas.  So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU," he told the BBC.Germany's gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports. Industry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany's gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics.German households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.

m_text : Who chooses his successor and when will we know the result?Candidates could only enter the race if they had the backing of 20 Tory MPs.Eight candidates secured enough support.They include former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, Attorney General Suella Braverman, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, and Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt.Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat and Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi are also nominated.The 358 Tory MPs will now hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later that day. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country - when the candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Political parties don't have to say how many members they have. However, about 160,000 people were eligible to vote during the last Tory leadership election. The party says that number has since grown. Under the current rules, we will know by 5 September at the latest. The result will be announced by 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady.We could know the new prime minister sooner if one of the final two candidates drops out and isn't replaced. This happened in 2016 when Dame Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race, leaving Theresa May as the only candidate.However, Sir Graham says he is "keen" that party members get to vote this time. Not necessarily. When a prime minister resigns, there isn't automatically a general election.However, Labour wants to force a no-confidence vote in the government, which is likely to happen in Parliament on Wednesday. If a simple majority of MPs votes in favour of it, then there could be a general election. This scenario is unlikely to happen, though, because it would require the support of dozens of Conservative MPs.The latest an election can be held is Yes. Despite standing down as leader of the Conservative Party, Mr Johnson is still the prime minister. Constitutionally, there needs to be a prime minister at all times. So Mr Johnson remains in post until his successor takes over.That will happen when a new Tory leader has been appointed.Once Mr Johnson has officially resigned, the newly-elected leader will be invited to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen who - on the advice of the ruling party - appoints a new prime minister.Until he goes to the Queen and formally resigns, in theory Mr Johnson keeps all his powers.However, in reality, he lacks the authority to introduce any substantial new policies, and has promised his cabinet he will not make any "major changes of direction".He will still represent the UK abroad, and can continue to make public appointments or changes to his team of ministers.One of his final acts in office is likely to be awarding knighthoods and appointments to the House of Lords in his resignation honours list.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The latest statistics show the number of people infected in the UK has So is summer ruined? Two-and-a-half years into the pandemic we're back facing new variants, a surge in infections, questions about whether the NHS can cope and what it means for all our lives. It's also giving us a clearer idea of what living with Covid is going to look like. "We're in a bad patch at the moment," says professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld. "It's very disruptive to society and some are suffering severe effects, but that's still a tiny proportion of where we were."The driving force behind the sudden surge in infections is the double act of BA.4 and BA.5. These two mutated forms of the virus are technically sub-variants of Omicron. The original Omicron had an impressive ability to spread and overcome the immune defences our bodies have built up to keep the virus out. BA.4 and BA.5 are even better. Their ascent started before big summer events like the Jubilee celebrations or Glastonbury so it's not like we've just partied our way into a new wave.Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, says it's "shocking" how much the virus is able to change to keep on infecting us. He recalls seeing the first scientific analysis of Omicron last winter: "I felt like I'd just seen the worst horror film on the planet and yet it keeps throwing up worse ones". The result is we're now entering another - arguably our third - Omicron wave of the year and it's only just July. Research in the The new sub-variants' slippery skills combined with our waning immunity means stories of catching Covid multiple times are now increasingly common. Plus there's still a surprising number - "[This virus] continues to surprise us in unpleasant ways, you would have hoped there would be more protection from one Omicron variant to another" says Prof Mark Woolhouse, who studies disease outbreaks at the University of Edinburgh. However, the most important form of protection - against becoming severely ill, ending up in hospital and dying - is clearly holding up. If there were 2.3 million cases in the era before vaccines then the NHS would be swamped and tens of thousands of people would die. That is clearly not happening. But even with that protection BA.4 and BA.5 still have the potential to leave you feeling seriously rough."I think it's far from a bad cold," says Prof Susan Hopkins, from the UK Health Security Agency, who says people are "ill for between seven and 10 days". That has knock-on effects if you need to work - staff sickness in the NHS is another way the virus can pile pressure on the health service - or were planning to go on a nice holiday. "What do you do if your school has no teachers or an airline has no pilots? How do you suck that up?" asks Prof Altmann.Rising cases will also have a disproportionate effect on There are no signs this virus is any more or less dangerous that original Omicron, but we don't know for sure. So far there is only laboratory and animal research. The UKHSA Prof Woolhouse, who was one of the scientists to However, variants don't have to be worse for it to impact the NHS - they just have to infect enough people. Then the small proportion who do get into trouble still add up to a big number.The number of people in hospital with Covid across the UK is 10,081 - up by around 2,500 in a week. More than half of those will be there for other reasons, such as a broken bone or a stroke, but they still need to be managed. "I remain concerned, one more doubling [in numbers] brings the NHS into significant challenge," says Prof Hopkins, the chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency.The hope will be that the UK follows a similar trajectory to countries like South Africa and also Portugal.Prof Bauld: "I think we should be optimistic, in those countries that are ahead of us, things are settling down, these things do burn themselves out as they run out of people to infect." However, it looks as though the idea that Covid will just become a winter bug is either wrong or someway off."Every year we say this and then it causes a wave in the summer, driven by new variants coming along more than once a year," warns Prof Woolhouse.  The virus may be looking more There is no political appetite to return to any restrictions. The big decision is going to be around the vaccination programme ahead of next winter - who gets vaccinated and equally importantly with what?Both How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

The label warned her she "had a lot of work to do" before she'd be ready to release a debut album - but when that album, Unguarded, arrived in 2015 it went straight into the Top 10, with critics praising its "Her 2018 follow-up, Someone Out There, was even better. Blending Bjorkian beats with soaring pop melodies, it shimmered with raw emotion. Morris captured the joy of falling in love with her producer Benjamin Garrett on Despite rave reviews, the album stalled at number 20 in the charts. Compared with label-mates like Anne-Marie and Ed Sheeran, Morris wasn't balancing the books. Eventually, she got the call she'd been dreading."I'm not afraid of the 'dropped' word," laughs the singer. "A lot of people avoid it and say things like, 'I was let go' or 'we parted ways'. I was definitely, fully dropped."In truth, the relationship had been on the rocks for a while.Morris winces at the memory of being told to wear crop tops and write "pop hits"; and of being "forced to dance" while promoting her second album. Despite those strains, she felt "lost and stressed" when the connection was severed."For a while, I'd avoid listening to music because it made me feel too sad," she says. "I'd get jealous and that wasn't a positive feeling".To pull her out of the funk, Garrett sat her down for an impromptu "job interview"."He said: 'Let's just start from the beginning. Why do you do what you do? What do you want to get out of this?' "And I had to be really honest. I'm a performer and I love being on stage. I love Calamity Jane and orchestral arrangements, but I also love Bjork's Hyperballad and Jon Brion's film music. "All of this stuff came out and I was like, 'Okay, there it is.'"Suddenly, Morris had a sonic palette for her new music - a sort of warped baroque pop, embellished with dreamy Doris Day stings and unexpected squiggles of electronica."Ordinarily, if I'd been signed to a label we would have had to go, 'Okay, but how do you make that commercial? How do you streamline that?'" she says. "But instead of doing that, Ben and I just started making music."One of the first songs she wrote was the sweeping ballad No Woman Is An Island - inspired by the sexism she encountered in the music industry."Someone at my old label described me as 'an island', because I didn't give enough of myself to people at parties and events," she explains. "He said 'You've got such a great smile, Rae. You need to go out more and let people experience that'.  I took that as a deep misunderstanding of who I was. It really bothered me for a long time. "So when I wasn't with them anymore, I realised that was the conclusive feeling of that time - that I was being slightly misunderstood. And women have that all the time, in all walks of life."In lesser hands, No Woman Is An Island could easily have been bitter. Morris gives it warmth and humour.Society reduces women to stereotypes, she sings, when really they hold "universes inside their heads" - from anxieties and memories and hopes and fears to "Kardashians in swimming pools" and recipes for banana bread. The lyrics were written as Morris became a mother for the first time, and found herself reflecting on her own strengths and capabilities."I'm good at stereotypically female roles like cleaning and laundry," she says, grinning that this also irritates her. More significantly, motherhood banished a tendency to "stress out about things that didn't warrant it". "If I look in the mirror and feel critical about the way I look, I immediately think, 'Imagine if she was doing that to herself?' I'd be really, deeply sad," Morris says."Already, that's quite a big thing in my day. So that's been an interesting change."The family have settled in London's Primrose Hill - living in a townhouse they've given an It's a long way from Morris's perfectly ordinary upbringing in Blackpool, as the child of a firefighter and an NHS worker. "I walk down the street in Primrose Hill sometimes, and I'm like, 'I don't think I belong here,'" she says. That feeling of displacement inspired her new album, Rachel@Fairyland, a poetic look back at her childhood (the title is the MSN handle she used, aged 11, when she was obsessed with fairies).Spitting From The Top is set at the peak of the Blackpool Tower, while The nostalgia is punctuated by several songs about her love affair with Garrett. The gorgeous They even duet on the playful Go Dancing, in which Morris is fired up for a night on the tiles, and Garrett is determined to stay at home - a situation that will resonate with anyone in a long-term relationship. The disagreement is illustrated in a priceless music video that, incredibly, was shot while the family was wracked with norovirus."It was awful, " she says. "There's a scene in the bathroom where I'm, like, drinking a shot of Sake but it was just water. And even that was enough to make me retch.""If you watch, you'll see how ill I am. But again, it's the parent thing, you just get on with it."The album's most affecting song is A Table For Two, in which Morris promises that, after death, she'll see Garrett in the afterlife."We don't talk about death often in our society - but I think it's a nice thing to tell someone you love, 'We'll meet again at our favourite crappy restaurant and have a really cheap bottle of wine'. "I don't think it gets more simple and real than that."The song has already become a fan favourite, after Morris sang it on tour with Tom Odell earlier this year.The reaction has reassured her that, three years after getting dropped, she was right to keep going. "The older I get, the more sure I am of what I should be doing," she says."It sounds really arrogant - but I've always had this deep ambition to be a national treasure. "I'm embarrassed to even say that and I spend a lot of time trying to convince myself to be less ambitious, to soften the blow. "But ultimately, I think that's unhealthy - because it doesn't matter if it doesn't happen, you should still be aiming for it."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : "So today we have 200,000-plus smartphones available to sell," he tells me.None of those smartphones are new, instead they have been refurbished, a process involving checks, repairs and cleaning.Once the phones meet the required standard they can then be sold with a one-year warranty on his company's website, Back Market, which operates in European countries plus the US.While smartphones are the big sellers, his website lists everything from coffee makers, laptops, to irons.Formed six years ago by Mr Hug de Larauze and two partners, Back Market does not refurbish the products itself, instead it provides a marketplace for hundreds of other firms to sell their used goods. It is one of many firms riding the wave of growth in refurbished electronics. Last year, around 137 million used smartphones were sold in the US and Europe, according to Counterpoint Research.Jeff Fieldhack, the head of research at research at Counterpoint, says that sales of used smartphones now account for about 10% of all smartphone sales.So what's the attraction of owning a second-hand phone that's a few years old? Why not buy a cheaper, brand new device? It all hinges on the so-called flagship phones from Samsung, Huawei and, in particular, Apple.Bought new these top of the range devices can be wildly expensive - Apple's top end iPhones will set you back more than £1,000.But within months of their launch they will start appearing on second-hand marketplaces with perhaps a 15% discount and after just two years the discount will be a healthy 50%."A flagship device from three, four years ago, from iPhone is still a better quality device, than something new in the $200 to $300 range," Mr Fieldhack says.A decade ago, used phones would typically be sold on marketplaces like eBay. It was hard for buyers to know the quality of the device they were buying and they would be unlikely to get a warranty.Now firms that sell refurbished electronics go to great lengths to reassure their buyers. In fact those in the industry would draw a clear line between phones that have been used and those that have been professionally refurbished."We want you to have exactly the same shopping experience that you would have in the Apple Store or PC World - ideally better," says Jon Godfrey, the founder of Tech.Trade, based in South Wales.His main product is refurbished computers. "If you buy something and change your mind and want to send it back, yeah, send it back," he says.The main problem he has is getting supplies of used computers. Most of his used machines come from people who are trading in machines they don't want anymore, but there's not enough of them.Mr Godfrey sold around 15,000 products last year, and could double that this year if he could get more products. "We're just starting to get to the point where we're dangerously low on stock," he says.That's mainly due to the surge in demand from people working from home during the pandemic - in May Mr Godfrey saw sales surge 35%, compared to the previous year.The second big challenge is replacement parts. Getting hold of screens and batteries can be difficult. Despite the challenges, those in the industry are forecasting bumper times ahead. Mr Hug de Larauze expects the sales of used smartphones to match sales of new devices by 2030.Analyst Jeff Fieldhack thinks that is a bit optimistic. He says that while firms have made big strides in improving quality and service, customers remain cautious, particularly in important markets like China, the Middle East and Eastern Europe."There's a lot of apprehension about the secondary market and in many markets the quality issue still needs to be overcome," he says.There is also the issue of software updates. Older phones might not get the latest software, which could make some apps unavailable.Much also hinges on the popularity of Apple products which account for 40% of sales of used smartphones. Many customers would rather own a second-hand Apple phone or computer, than a new one from a different firm."Apple just is so dominant in the secondary market because they have such brand value and very expensive devices," says Mr Fieldhack. "These are $800-and-above devices that are sold in the US market for $200. That is a very attractive value proposition for consumers who are priced out of iPhones but want to get in that [Apple] ecosystem."While the quality of Apple products makes them desirable in the used market, Apple and other smartphone makers have been criticised for making their devices difficult to repair."They also make some aspects of refurbishment incredibly challenging by design and by policy," says Mr Godfrey.There are moves to remedy that situation.In the US, The Repair Association is pushing for legislation that would force firms to release manuals and other information necessary to repair products.And All of that would make life easier for refurbishment firms.In its defence Apple says it is already making devices more repairable but this needed to be balanced with creating devices that are durable and can endure the rigours of everyday use.To helper smaller repair firms, in July Apple launched a programme offering training and access to Apple parts.The refurbishment industry also operates in the shadow of huge marketing campaigns from the smartphone industry.Mr Hug de Larauze says massive advertising tells people everyday that what they have in their pocket is too old.He wants consumers to resist those messages, not just because it would be good for his business, but because it benefits the environment as well."Do you need something new? No, I think not. I think you should maybe consider repair and just keep as long as possible."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : Health leaders from the four UK nations were awarded the medal at a small ceremony at Windsor Castle on Tuesday. It is only the third time ever that a George Cross has been awarded to an organisation rather than an individual.Joining the event was May Parsons, the nurse who delivered the world's first vaccine outside of clinical trials on 8 December 2020.The Queen said the vaccine effort which began on that day was "amazing" as she celebrated the achievements of the NHS.Also on Tuesday, Olympic diver Tom Daley and personal finance expert Martin Lewis were presented with awards, both receiving OBEs. Wearing a day dress and moving with the aid of a walking stick, Her Majesty said it was "tremendous" that tens of millions of people in the UK had taken up the jab. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard paid tribute to those who worked on the front line and said the vaccine programme saved hundreds of thousands of lives. She told the Queen that the medal will go on a tour of the NHS before a permanent home is found.Lt Col Michael Vernon, comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's office with responsibility for organising ceremonial events, said: "This award recognises all NHS staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations. "Over more than seven decades, and especially in recent times, you have supported the people of our country with courage, compassion and dedication, demonstrating the highest standards of public service."You have our enduring thanks and heartfelt appreciation."NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was honoured to attend on behalf of workers. "Under the most difficult of circumstances during the pandemic, our staff responded magnificently," she said.Other guests included NHS Wales chief executive Judith Paget and Dr Ami Jones, an Army reservist and intensive care consultant with Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.Caroline Lamb, chief executive of NHS Scotland, received the George Cross with Eleanor Grant, a palliative care nurse from Specialist University Hospital Wishaw, NHS Lanarkshire.Peter May, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and chief executive of Health and Social Care Northern Ireland, was joined by Sister Joanna Hogg, from Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital's Emergency Department.She played a lead role in setting up Covid drive-through testing pods at her hospital and later managed its vaccination centre.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses were hit, leaving seven dead and up to 80 hurt.It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties.Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media.Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak attributed the attack to the US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launcher and spoke of a "reality collision" for the world's "second army". A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing "peaceful cities with American weapons".Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack.Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing.Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now "minus" its ammunition depot.While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line.Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians.The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close.Meanwhile, Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities has claimed further lives. The number killed in Saturday's attack on a five-storey block of flats in the eastern town of Chasiv Yar has risen to 45, including one child, local officials say. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble.The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded.BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats. There were multiple holes in the ground and shrapnel damage at the scene, she said, from what looked like cluster bombs: "People tell me it was the heaviest night of shelling they remember."

m_text : A rare amber warning for much of England and Wales has been issued from midnight on Sunday.That means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness from the scorching temperatures.Extreme heat is hitting Europe with Seville reaching 42C while France, Germany and Italy are expected to experience similar highs.In England the highest temperatures of the day were around London, east England and south-east England. So far 31.7C has been recorded in Wisley, Surrey, 31.5C in Charlwood, Surrey, and 31.3C at Heathrow, west London. The UK Health Security Agency has issued Level 3 heat-health alerts across the south and east of England, the Midlands and London.This requires health and social care workers to pay particular attention to high-risk groups of people such as the elderly and vulnerable.Downing Street said "significant work" was being done across government to ensure the most vulnerable were protected during the heatwave.It comes as all ambulance services in England have been put on the highest level of alert due to "extreme pressures", partly due to the hot weather.The TUC wants employers to keep workplaces cool, relax dress codes and allow flexible working to make use of the coolest hours of the day.General secretary Frances O'Grady added: "And bosses must make sure outdoor workers are protected with regular breaks, lots of fluids, plenty of sunscreen and the right protective clothing."UK law does not state a minimum or maximum temperature for workplaces but they should normally be at least 16C or 13C if much of the job involves rigorous physical effort. The Royal Life Saving Society UK has also warned people about the dangers of trying to cool off in lakes, quarries and rivers in hot weather. The charity recommends swimmers head to lifeguarded sites, not to go too far from the shore and to take a friend when swimming. The warning comes as a 16-year-old boy who died Forecasters are predicting that the UK could face its hottest day ever next week.The current record was in July 2019 when 38.7C was recorded at Cambridge Botanic Garden but as extreme heat builds across Sunday into Monday, next week could see that temperature being topped.Wales saw its hottest day of the year on Monday with Cardiff's Bute Park reaching 28.7C.In other heatwave developments across the UK: This video can not be playedBBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying coolHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of climate change.The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began in the latter half of the 18th century, and some experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.In England, there were 2,500 excess deaths in the summer of 2020 as a result of hot weather, and the Red Cross predicts that heat-related deaths in the UK could treble in 30 years.Portugal and Spain are currently the worst affected countries in Europe - extreme heat and drought conditions are fuelling wildfires in central Portugal where state emergency measures have been introduced. An unprecedented 80% of mainland Portugal is at "exceptional" risk of fires, according to the national meteorological institute.Wildfires and heatwaves are not unusual in this part of Europe but they are becoming more severe, happening sooner than usual and more frequently, says BBC reporter Azadeh Moshiri.BBC Weather presenter Susan Powell said this could be the longest sustained heatwave seen in Spain for 50 years.She added: "We know from climatology research that the earth's atmosphere now holds its highest energy levels on record, ie, amounts of heat."It's this global scale shift that leads to the increased likelihood of extreme weather events - such as heatwaves."On Tuesday, a group of leading UK scientists suggested that heatwaves should be named similar to storms. Seville in Spain, which is seeing its second heatwave of the season, recently started doing this.Professor Mike Tipton from the Physiological Society said naming heatwaves would raise awareness and "makes the risk to health clear". "People can't expect to continue as normal during the heatwave", he added.How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : The fierce and protracted battle that had been predicted for Lysychansk was avoided, according to the regional governor, by a strategic withdrawal. Serhiy Haidai told me: "Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed it from a distance, so there was no point in staying."That does seem to tally with Russian accounts of the capture of the city, seemingly moving in unopposed. Videos posted on social media on Sunday show Chechen fighters dancing in the central districts. And well they might celebrate. The capture of Lysychansk means that Russia has essentially taken the entire Luhansk region, a key strategic aim of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine.So, what does it mean both for the battle for the Donbas, but also the wider war?Let's start from the Ukrainian perspective. For them, the crucial thing was to avoid an encirclement, as was seen in Mariupol. Although their defence of the southern port city did slow the Russian advance by many weeks, the end result was the killing or capture of thousands of the most capable soldiers in the Ukrainian army. Ukraine wanted to avoid that at all costs. In his nightly address, President Zelensky stated this explicitly. "We will rebuild the walls, we will regain the land, but people must be saved above all else," he told the nation.Serhiy Haidai made exactly the same point, telling me: "Our troops have retreated to more fortified positions… We held the defence of Luhansk for five months. While that defence was holding, we were building new fortifications in the Donetsk region. Now the troops have gone there." Writing a few hours after the fall of Lysychansk, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych even went as far as calling the defence of Lysychansk-Severodonetsk "a successful military operation".Given that the Russian flag now flies above both cities, that logic may seem a little perverse, but his point is that they were playing a long game, buying valuable time. To understand this logic, you need to understand the importance of Western weapons to Ukraine's resistance. In short, without Nato supplies they would be in even greater trouble than they currently are. The longer they can delay the Russian advance, the more advanced rocket and artillery systems they can bring to the fight. US-provided HIMARS, already in action, are said to radically alter the balance of the conflict. More time means more supplies, which in turn tips the scales in their favour, especially given that sanctions mean Russia is struggling to replace its spent hardware and ammunition.Now for the Russian perspective. Their stated aim is the capture, they say "liberation", of the Donbas. Taking Luhansk brings that one step closer. Indeed, its significance was highlighted by President Putin today, when he made the commanders of the offensive "Heroes of Russia", the Federation's highest possible award. But what next? It seems almost certain that they will push on to try to take the rest of the Donbas, especially the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled in recent days. Sloviansk is said to hold particular significance to the separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their forces if - when - they take the Donbas.President Putin tacitly acknowledged this today, saying: "The units that took part in active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities."If they are still making rapid advances they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond.If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the "special military operation", Russia's euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry it could be that the frontline becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest.For now, none of this is certain, with both sides claiming they have the upper hand. Indeed, it is worth noting that while Ukraine is on the back foot in the Donbas, they have had recent successes, most notably retaking Snake Island, where today the blue and yellow flag was once again raised.The only thing of which we can be sure - this war will not be over any time soon, with the people of the Donetsk region set to be the next to suffer its consequences.

m_text : Radio 2's Zoe Ball is in second place. Her full-year pay dropped below £1m for the first time since taking over the station's Breakfast Show in 2019.Not all earnings are published - for example, Graham Norton's fee for his BBC One chat show is not included because it is produced by a commercial company.The stars of EastEnders, Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing, which are made by commercial arm BBC Studios, are missing for similar reasons - although Claudia Winkleman's salary for her Radio 2 programme is listed.With those caveats in mind, here are the presenters who earned above £150,000 last year, according to the BBC's accounts.

m_text : The university professor has been teaching online since the pandemic but for the past few months, he has been educating his students from the frontline. The 47-year-old signed up to the military after the Russian invasion but he was eager for his students to continue their education. The result? He conducts twice-weekly classes on topics such as tourism and sociology from the trenches on his phone. "I've been teaching for 27 years. I can't just abandon that. It's what I'm good at," he tells the BBC. Mr Shandor has been teaching while serving in the military since Russia invaded in February. He signed up because he wanted to fight for his country and protect his wife and daughter. "I should stop the Russians before they come to my house," he says. Mr Shandor's dedication to his job has also helped keep participation numbers up. "Even students who would skip classes before, turn up to every lecture," says one of his students, 20-year-old Iryna. "He has always told us that we have to be smart, that we are fighting for a smart nation." But teaching in the trenches is not easy, and the students have had to get used to hearing shelling in the background.. "During one class, the sounds were very loud and so the students heard everything. Then I hid in the trenches and continued to teach," he says. Through his surroundings, he's also been able to show his students shrapnel and teach them about different missiles. Mr Shandor's lessons are also something of a novelty to his fellow soldiers, who often tune into his lectures and take pictures of him at work. One of those pictures, showing him holding his phone in a trench, was posted online and went viral across Ukraine. A number of artists around the country have since made drawings and cartoons of the moment. Mr Shandor isn't the only teacher currently fighting on the frontline. According to Ukraine's Education Minister, Serhiy Shkarlet, some 900 teachers have joined the armed forces so far. "We ae proud of each and every one of them," he says. "We have people who have joined the armed forces of Ukraine in the Ministry of Education too."Others, such as Anton Tselovalnyk, have joined the territorial defence. His lessons were cancelled during the first two weeks of the war, but after time, schools that he had worked with in the past started messaging him, asking for help. The 42-year-old instantly responded, opting to teach classes in the trenches or in the nearby housing for territorial defence personnel. Nothing can stop him from missing a class, not even the cold weather. He says that at first it wasn't about teaching the kids, it was more about talking and supporting each other. "You can imagine, the children used to go to school every day and then it suddenly stopped."He has been teaching his students - who range from primary to high school - about architecture. "The most important thing now is to keep the connection between your past and your future. Teaching now is like that for me too," he says. One of his students, 17-year-old Veronika Volkova, says Mr Tselovalnyk's lectures are funny in order to keep the class in a good mood. "It's the best distraction," she says, adding that her teacher will often show the class his surroundings, telling them about the trenches he has helped build and the places where he sits and looks at the stars. "He's thoughtful and caring during lectures. Always asking for feedback, trying to keep the subject interesting for us," Ms Volkova adds. Other teachers, such as Maksym Kozhemiaka, are using their medical skills to help the military. The 41-year-old professor of trauma medicine at Zaporizhzhia State University realised he could be of use at the city's military hospital and volunteered to help. But after a few days working there, he discovered a way of helping his students continue their studies too. "We thought we could teach classes online," he says. "We already had experience in online teaching during Covid."And so after a challenging first two weeks of the war, Mr Kozhemiaka resumed teaching by letting his students watch him conduct operations online. They use a mixture of live classes and augmented reality to allow their students to participate and comment on operations even from their own homes. "We've taught young doctors and students how to deal with combat wounds," he says. Daryna Bavysta, has joined in Mr Kozhemiaka's classes and says she has learnt a lot since they restarted. "Now I understand everything that is happening on the operating table," she says. "Maksym explains everything during his online live operations - what he is doing and how," she says.  But she is worried about her teacher: "It's not only psychologically difficult but physically - you want to give everything to the people you're treating. Our soldiers."For Mr Kozhemiaka, abandoning his classes was not an option. "Teaching is the work of my life," he says. "I couldn't abandon it. We were on the right track as a country before the war and we still are, so we need to fight together for our victory and stay united.""It's important to continue working on what you did before. Why should a war stop us?"

m_text : There is the urge to breathe out. Just one big exhalation to relieve the pressure. But Ivan knows it will be the death of him if he does. The temperature is just above freezing. Warm breath rising into cold air will create a small fog and alert the killers. They are already checking the bodies of the men they have just shot, making sure, firing a final bullet where they see any sign of life. He hears one of the Russians say: "That one is still alive!" Ivan wonders if they are talking about him? Maybe it is one of the others. Still, he prepares himself for the bullet. He is already bleeding from a wound in his side. The other Russian says: "He will die by himself!"But then there is a shot. It strikes somebody else. A man fights different urges in such moments. The bullet wound in his side is agonisingly painful. But crying out would be fatal. All of this will come back later in dreams. But for now, he will lie among the dead. He will be as still as his murdered comrades.  I meet Ivan Skyba in a small village in rural Poland where he has found shelter for his family. He has a job. The kids are living in a place without fear. The warm weather has arrived and in the evenings the family walk to a local park where Ivan fishes in the lake. The bruises on his face and body have healed. But at night, after everybody else is asleep, the wounds of memory are open. Ivan Skyba is the man who came back from the dead.When it all started in the early hours of 24 February, Ivan was driving his taxi in Kyiv. He heard explosions. Ivan struggled to believe it was actually happening. "I didn't imagine it coming," he says.The dispatcher called and said all taxis were to return to base. Forty-three year old Ivan had been doing whatever work he could find to support his wife and four children. He drove the cab and sometimes worked as a building renovator. His first thought that morning was to get the family's identification documents. If they were going to have to flee, they needed passports. He quickly drove the 40km towards Brovary where they lived - and from there to Bucha where his wife and children were visiting her mother. That was where the family would stay until they could make a plan. "Different rumours were circulating that [the Russians] were approaching Bucha. We started arranging shelters in the cellars, bringing things there."Three days later, on 27 February, the Russians arrived nearby. Almost immediately they suffered a devastating ambush by Ukrainian artillery. A column of Russian airborne troops had taken up position on Vokzalna Street when the shells came screaming in. They retreated temporarily. But they were angry, convinced some locals had told the Ukrainian military of their location.By now, across Ukraine, people were mobilising to defend their communities. Bucha was no exception. Ivan Skyba and his friend, Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather to his two-year-old daughter Zlata, heard that some men who had fought in the eastern Donbas region against the Russian-backed separatists were forming in Bucha a unit of Ukraine's Territorial Defence Force, a militia to protect local communities in time of war. The two men joined up."We were doing duty at checkpoints, checking documents and making sure people didn't carry arms," says Ivan. "We were helping to organise people's safe passage out because we knew the area." Ivan's unit was poorly armed. They had one rifle, a grenade and a pair of binoculars to share among nine men. He and his comrades worked shifts on a checkpoint on Yablunska Street. In Ukrainian it means "the street of the apples", because of the trees that line much of its nearly 6km length. In peacetime, it is a pleasant place with a lake for fishing. Some of the houses back on to fields and orchards. It is also the site of an old office complex, built in the Soviet era, part of which has been transformed into workspaces for local businesses. These quarters at 144 Yablunska Street would become a Russian base notorious in the story of the war's brutality.By early March, Ukrainians were fleeing the country in their hundreds of thousands. Ivan and his wife decided the family should try to shelter in Bucha for the time being. He describes the atmosphere among the men as one of defiance. "There was no fear. No fear. There was a desire to unite, to get together. We were on our feet all the time. When we were off duty, we would distribute food around cellars to those who were taking shelter there, the women and children. There was no time to be afraid."That changed dramatically on 3 March. The Russians returned in force "in the second half of the day, around lunchtime".Immediately, Ivan and the others began directing cars away from the direction of the Russian advance. There was indiscriminate firing. Rockets were landing. He saw a white Renault being struck and a woman and her children trapped inside the burning car. There were eight men at Ivan's checkpoint and with the Russians rapidly approaching they decided to try to hide. Directly opposite the checkpoint, at number 31 Yablunska Street, was Valera Kotenko's house. The 53-year-old had given them hot drinks and food. He offered shelter now. Soon the Russians were outside."We could hear them and the movement of their equipment. We were surrounded," says Ivan. The men whispered to each other. They could not run. The Russians had thermal imaging detectors that would surely pick up any attempt to escape at night. The men had already ditched their few weapons and now decided on a cover story - if the Russians found them they would say they were builders working in the district and had been sheltering from the fighting.They texted wives and girlfriends. One of the men, Anatoliy Prykhidko, aged 39, called his wife Olha that evening - 3 March - and whispered "that he couldn't speak because he could be heard. It was so quiet. He said they were in hiding."The following morning, Yulia, the wife of Andriy Dvornikov, a delivery driver, received a message saying: "We have been encircled, we are sitting here, but I will be getting away from here as soon as there is an opportunity." He told her to delete all messages and photographs from her phone. And he told her that he loved her. With tears streaming down her face, Olha Prykhidko, tells me of her last communication from Anatoliy on the morning of 4 March: "At 10:00, he sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message."Less than an hour later the Russians broke in. Ivan Skyba remembers beatings and shouted questions. Mobile phones and shoes were confiscated. By 11:00 two different sets of CCTV images captured the men being led across and then down Yablunska Street towards number 144. Each had one hand on the belt of the man in front and the other on their own head. They were lined up against a wall next to the Russian base and made to kneel. The Russians forced their shirts and sweaters over their heads so that they could not see . They were beaten with rifle butts and verbally abused. According to Ivan they shouted: "You are the Bandera fighters (an anti-Soviet nationalist group in World War Two). You wanted to burn us with Molotov cocktails! We'll burn you alive now!"This video can not be playedCCTV shows the men being marched at gunpoint to the location where they were killedIvan says the Russians decided to intimidate the others by shooting 28-year-old Vitaliy Karpenko, a worker at a co-operative store. After this, a younger man in the group panicked and told the Russians that all of them belonged to the Territorial Defence Unit. The beatings intensified.Ivan Skyba and another man, Andriy Verbovyi, a father of one and a woodworker, were brought into the building. In the interrogation that followed, Ivan had a bucket placed over his head and was made to bend and lean against the wall. Bricks were piled, one after the other on his back, until he collapsed. He was beaten again and a brick was repeatedly smashed against the bucket. At some point he heard the police tell Andriy Verbovyi that they would shoot him in the foot. There was a shot. After that he didn't hear Andriy any more.Ivan was then led back out of the building to join the other men. Some of what took place was witnessed by local residents who were ordered to gather by the Russians in front of number 144, but kept separate from the arrested men. Lucy Moskalenko remembers a Russian officer telling her to cover her daughters' eyes because they would see things they would never forget. "He told us, 'Don't look at those people lying on the ground. They are not humans. They are absolute dirt. Dirt. They are not human. They are beasts.'" Her sister, Irina Volynets, had accompanied Lucy. Both recall the noise of the Russian armoured vehicles, the sound of shelling, and how the dogs of the neighbourhood were fighting with each other. It was as if a madness had descended on the place.Then Irina had a shock. She saw that her old classmate, Andriy Verbovyi, the boy who had sat beside her from kindergarten, and all the way up through school, was lying bleeding on the ground. Only a few weeks before, they had walked home from the shopping centre together. There was a sheet thrown on the ground near him. "He was lying there, all twisted from cold. He was looking straight at me. We looked into each other's eyes," she says. Irina wanted to go and cover her old friend with the sheet, anything that might make him warmer. But she did not. "Was she too afraid?" I ask."It was not so much fear as despair," she replies, "and I was really confused at the time, and couldn't seem to grasp how it happened, and why my classmate was lying there on the ground." Everything was happening so fast. Besides, she had just seen that her son Slavyk was among the line of men. He had been captured separately and beaten, before being brought to join the others. Waiting in the line Slavyk saw blood on the ground nearby, and heard the Russians talking about a wounded man. This was almost certainly Andriy Verbovyi. "I heard them talk among themselves to finish him off because he wouldn't make it," recalls Slavyk. He began to fear for his own life.Irina found an officer and pleaded for Slavyk's life. The soldier listened. Then he called over a Ukrainian informer - possibly the arrested man who had cracked after the shooting of Vitaliy Karpenko - and asked him: "Is he one of them?""No," came the reply. Slavyk was released to his mother. The residents were told to go home, but Irina remembers an ominous feeling as she left. "I was afraid horrible things would happen."On the following day, 5 March, Andriy Verbovyi's wife, Natalya, sent him a message."Where are you? Your [good luck] chain is with me, the amulet as well. I am protecting you from all bad things. We are praying for you. We are waiting for your call. Write us at least two words." By then, Andriy was dead.Ivan Skyba sensed time was running out. By late afternoon on 4 March, two of the eight men captured with him had been shot dead. "The Russians started talking between themselves as to what they would do with us. The conversation was as follows: 'What shall we do with them?' The second man says, 'Finish them off, but just take them out, so that they wouldn't be lying here.'"The remaining men were led around the corner into a small courtyard. From under the edge of his clothing Ivan saw the body of a man lying on a small concrete platform. He had clearly been shot earlier. The Russians began taunting their victims. "They were enjoying the execution, using swear words, saying, "That's it. It's kapooey (death) for you!" Ivan recalls a final exchange of words with his comrades. "We said goodbye to each other. That was it." Among those to whom he bade farewell was Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather of his daughter.According to Ivan, Anatoliy Prykhidko suddenly decided to make a run for it but was shot straight away. Then the Russians opened fire on the others. "I felt a bullet go into my side," Ivan remembers. "It wounded me and I fell."Ivan cannot remember exactly how long the Russians stayed, but it was more like minutes than hours. When he sensed they were gone he risked a glance from under his jacket. The courtyard was empty of life. Now was his chance. He reached out towards a pair of feet near him - those of the dead man he had noticed when they first entered the courtyard. He pulled off the man's shoes to put on his own exposed feet. He then crawled to a fence and dragged himself across into nearby gardens. There was another fence to cross before he made it into a house abandoned by its owners during the shelling.What followed was another terrifying ordeal. Inside the house, Ivan treated his wound with some antiseptic liquid he found in the bathroom and changed into clothes left behind by the householder. He wrapped himself in a blanket and tried to sleep. But he was disturbed by voices. Russian voices. It turned out that several Russian soldiers were also resting in the house."They saw me and started asking me who I was and what I was doing there." He persuaded them that he was the owner of the house and that his family had been evacuated. His wounds, he explained, were the result of shelling. The soldiers believed his story but they told him he couldn't stay where he was. Instead, they said they would take him to their base for medical treatment. Back at 144 Yablunska Street. "I was terrified what would happen next - from one captivity into another."But Ivan's luck held. At the base, combat medics treated his wounds. If the troops who shot him were still around, they either did not see him return, or did not recognise him. He was placed with civilians sheltering in the bunker of the building. After several days, they were allowed to leave. The bodies of the murdered men who had been defending Bucha with Ivan were left lying in the courtyard, where the Russians dumped rubbish, for the remaining month of the occupation. Ivan found his family, still sheltering from the war, at home. They were able to flee Bucha, and eventually Ukraine into Poland, but not the legacy of the terrible hours at 144 Yablunska. Military defeat forced the retreat. Harried by Ukrainian forces the Russians pulled out of Bucha on 31 March and headed north to the border with Belarus.The invaders left behind numerous traces of their presence. From the banal - obscene graffiti scrawled on the walls - to the potentially significant. We found a soldier's military-issued debit card on the floor of 144 Yablunska, and traced him to Pskov in north-western Russia, a major base for airborne forces. Other journalists found evidence leading to the same units - the 104th and 234th Airborne Assault regiments.A Bucha resident found Ivan Skyba's mobile phone, left behind by the Russians as they retreated. It contained records of calls made to several numbers in Russia. The records don't link any of the callers directly to the massacre. The phone might easily have been passed around among a large group of soldiers. But the call records could help narrow down the search for perpetrators to smaller units within the regiments present when Ivan and the others were shot.The killings at 144 Yablunska Street and elsewhere in Bucha are the focus of a huge war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court and Ukraine. The Ukrainian investigation is led by a police lawyer who, until recently, was best known for investigating cases of brutality within the country's police force. Walking me around the crime scene, Yuriy Belousov is hopeful the perpetrators will ultimately face justice."These Russian soldiers who have committed this crime, they could be captured somewhere," he says, pointing to the recent trial of a Russian prisoner of war accused of murdering a civilian near Kyiv. But the big targets of the investigation are President Putin and the Russian military and political elite."It was planned in advance," Mr Belousov says. "It was instructed from the top how to behave. So the suspects would be top of the top, the guys who actually launch the war, let's say. It's like a chain of people whose decisions led to the invasion of Ukraine." Barring a change of regime in Moscow, any imminent prosecution seems highly unlikely.If there are prosecutions, Ivan Skyba will be a vital witness. For now, he works with the Polish man who has given the family shelter. The Russians seem physically far away. But there is the terror that comes at night. "You wake up because you are anticipating that shot in your head. I have this feeling. It comes like a wave."When we walk to a nearby lake in the evening, I notice that a teenaged boy has joined the family group. He plays with Ivan's son who is just a few years younger. Ivan tells me that the teenager is the child of his murdered friend and godfather to his daughter, Svyatoslav Turovsky. The boy and his mother moved to Poland with the Skyba family.It is a perfect early summer's evening - the boys fishing, Ivan leaning against a tree and looking on, his wife shepherding their young daughter away from the water's edge. But for Ivan and his family, for their friends the Turovskyis, for all the families of the men of 144 Yablunska, Russia's invasion and the massacre it unleashed has changed everything.I remember the words of Olha Prykhidko, whose husband Anatoliy tried to run for his life, and whose grave she visits every day with two cups of coffee, one for him and one for her.  "When no-one can hear me," she says, "I call him by his name." Day after day she calls to him, from silence to silence, into the emptiness made by war.© 2022 BBC.

m_text : In the HBO show, Cox plays the ageing patriarch of the Waystar RoyCo conglomerate who famously peppers his speech with curses and is particularly fond of dismissing underlings with a two-word epithet."The F-word, nobody does it like the Scots," he says. The 75-year-old actor says he swore in the past, but now seems to be possessed by Logan's bad language."There is a lot more swearing now," he tells presenter Amy Irons on Cox even accidentally swore on an episode of daytime TV show Loose Women, although he didn't use Logan's favourite word.The role of Logan Roy, for which he won a best actor award at the Golden Globes in 2020, has been a late career highlight for Cox, who started acting in Dundee more than 60 years ago.He tells the BBC show that his first taste of performing came at the age of three when he was woken at one in the morning to do Al Jolson impersonations - minus the black face - for his parents' Hogmanay party guests.He says he was a natural performer and always loved the limelight, but his childhood was blighted by the death of his father when he was eight and his mother's recurrent mental illnesses."My father's death was beyond my comprehension," he says."They put me in front of a TV for my father's funeral. So I was entertained while my dad was buried."In a way, I have always found television a comforter. I am a great television watcher."Despite a chaotic childhood and an educational record he describes as a disaster, Cox found himself at Dundee Repertory Theatre at the age of just 14.Within a couple of years he was studying in London, returning to Scotland in 1965 to perform in the first shows at the the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, before moving to Birmingham Rep, where he performed many of the most iconic roles in theatre while still in his late teens.Cox has also starred in dozens of TV shows and films, notably playing Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter in 1986, two years before Anthony Hopkins made the character his own in Silence of the Lambs.Despite decades of roles in major films, he says the reception to Logan Roy has surpassed anything else in his career.The previews of the third season were big in New York, but were like a rock concert in London."I remember walking on stage and I have never had a reaction like that in my whole career," he says.While many view Logan Roy as a monster, Cox has a soft spot for the tycoon who he jokes is "the most misunderstood man on television"."As an actor, you never judge who you are playing," he says.Cox says all Logan is trying to do is find a successor to run his empire and he wants it to be one of his kids. "Is that such a bad thing?" he asks.He defends Logan from accusations of being a terrible father, saying that his grown-up children should take some of the blame."You can't blame your parents for everything," he says. "You are an adult and eventually you are responsible for your own life. You can't always make your parent the fall guy."My own kids are quite generous that way. They excuse me because they know what my life is."For Logan, it is a different thing. Those kids have so much and they are ruined by that. They are avaricious and they are spoilt."Cox, who has two children in their late teens as well as older children from a previous marriage, says that like Logan his career can get in the way of being a good father."I don't think of myself as a particularly good father because I was absent for a lot of the time. "In a way, like Logan, I was attending to my career. Like Logan, there is an element when he has been remiss at dealing with his children."But unlike Logan, I express myself more about being remiss in that area and I'm constantly apologising for it. Logan would certainly find me a bit boring. I feel that quite strongly."How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : His story was a "shocking reminder" of the horrors of trafficking, the prime minister's official spokesperson added.Sir Mo Fellow Olympian Sir Brendan Foster said his story was like a "Hollywood movie".Downing Street said work to clamp down on perpetrators must continue, while praise has come from a wide variety of figures across British public life.Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he "salutes" Sir Mo Farah, describing the Olympic star as "truly inspirational" and an "amazing human".  Having fled Iraq when he was just 11-years-old himself, Mr Zahawi said it felt "painful" to learn of Sir Mo's experiences as a boy. "I salute Mo Farah. What an amazing human being to go through that trauma in childhood, and to come through it and be such a great role model is truly inspirational," he told the BBC.Sir Mo, who won four Olympic gold medals for Team GB, had previously said he came to the UK from Somalia with his parents as a refugee.This video can not be playedWATCH: People know me as Mo Farah, but it's not my nameSir Mo reveals to the programme that his real name is in fact Hussein Abdi Kahin. Mr Zahawi said he felt "lucky" to have had his parents with him when they were forced to flee from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq."I didn't understand why we were fleeing Saddam Hussein, I knew he was a dictator, I knew he was bad," he said.Sir Brendan Foster said he was "absolutely staggered" by Sir Mo's disclosure."I thought I knew the Mo Farah story and I thought I knew Mo Farah really well," Sir Brendan told the BBC.He described his story as a "Hollywood movie", adding that it was an "amazing, successful story of someone overcoming adversity."He said it was "amazing" that the Olympian had emerged from his childhood experiences with a "light-hearted personality" and "steely determination". Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for levelling up, suggested that the decision to speak out about trafficking could be a "gamechanger".London Mayor Sadiq Khan praised Sir Mo for highlighting the crime of child trafficking, adding: "We must build a future where these tragic events are never repeated".Dame Sara Thornton, the UK's Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said fear and manipulation stopped many victims of trafficking and slavery from speaking out. "They will have been told that the authorities won't help them, they will be under the control of their traffickers and their abusers, they may have been physically or psychologically threatened," she told BBC's Today programme."Victims don't realise that in fact they are victims of a crime."Comedian David Baddiel described Sir Mo as a "hero", sharing a picture of the pair, alongside fellow comedian Frank Skinner,  in a tweet which read: "Whether he's Sir Mo Farah or Hussein Abdi Kahin he's a hero."You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST or on BBC iPlayer at 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).How a railway blurred the line between Belgium and GermanyThe month’s most unmissable released include the return of Jordan Peele and ThorCan online dating burnout be stopped?© 2022 BBC.

m_text : This video can not be playedIPL: India police arrest organisers of fake cricket matchThe video is soundless - a blue strap at the bottom of the screen tells you the scores of the batting team, the two batters, the projected score and the bowling records. It says that Chennai Fighters are chasing a score of 151 set by the Gandhinagar Challengers. The outfield is brown and dusty, and the cricket pitch is a whitish carpet nailed to the ground. The Chennai team is scoring at a steady clip of nearly seven runs an over. Strokes are sometimes played but we never see a ball reach the boundary. The batters mostly run clumsy ones or twos. The umpire appears to be more enthusiastic than the players, waving his hands vigorously, signalling wides and no balls. In keeping with the rather amiable mood of the game, a bowler doesn't seem to be interested in running out a batsman who's stranded yards away from the crease. A young man comes running to the field with what looks like an ice box, and players take a drinks break. There are no close-up shots of the players, most of the fielders and no views of an audience. All this looks like a local, video-recorded Twenty20 cricket match being played somewhere in India. Except this was part of what the police call a "fake" cricket tournament involving a group of unemployed men in Gujarat state and a bunch of punters curiously based in Russia.  Acting on a tip-off, police in Mehsana district of Gujarat last week arrested four men for staging the tournament and accepting bets through social media app Telegram from punters from three cities in Russia. Bhavesh Rathod, the officer investigating the case, said one of the four men had worked in a pub in Russia and "had some contacts there, and had got them interested in betting in cricket".India hosts the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket competition. Some states such as Tamil Nadu have also launched their own franchise-model local leagues modelled on the lines of IPL. While Indian laws do not allow sports betting (except for horse racing), police say there is often a lot of illegal gambling in cricket. Joy Bhattacharjya, a sports producer and a former director of an IPL team, said fake leagues such as the one in Mehsana were purely run for illegal gambling. "Organisers live-stream these fixed games, where the umpires openly give instructions to players. They are completely staged," he said.The Mehsana "tournament" was busted after more than nine games were played in a remote location in Molipur village, the police said. They seized cricket kits, cameras and even speakers which would amplify the running commentary to "basically set the mood".The league - which was called Century Hitters T20 - had half-a-dozen "teams" named after different Indian states, nearly two dozen locals who were paid to turn out for all the teams, two umpires, and two organisers, the police said. One of the organisers doubled up as a commentator and mimicked a well-known cricket Indian pundit. Two high-definition cameras beamed the matches on a Most of the betters were based in Moscow, Voronezh and Tver, police said. To give the games a more authentic feel, a running commentary spiked with crowd sounds downloaded from the internet was blasted through speakers placed near the ground.Umpires would use walkie-talkies to communicate with the organisers, who would connect with the punters through Telegram. The umpires would also give instructions to the players and influence the outcome of the game.The "players" - who were paid 400 rupees ($5; £4.22) for a game - have already agreed to co-operate with the police in the case, according to Mr Rathod.  "I have never seen a scam like this. These guys just cleared a patch of land deep inside a village and began playing a match and beaming it on YouTube to make money through gambling. Even the local villagers were not aware of this. We know very little about the Russians who were putting bets on this game," Mr Rathod said.And what about the audiences?"There were no audiences!"
